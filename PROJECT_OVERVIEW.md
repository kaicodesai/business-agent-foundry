> ## AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — READ THIS FIRST
>
> **At the start of every session:**
> 1. Read this entire file before doing anything else
> 2. Use the API credentials, table IDs, field names, and workflow IDs here as ground truth — do not guess or fetch from external sources unless this file says a value is missing
> 3. Check Current Status before building anything — do not rebuild what already exists
> 4. Run the smoke test to confirm your environment is connected
>
> **At the end of every session:**
> 1. Update this file ONCE at the end of the session — not after every task
> 2. Update **Known Issues** — resolve fixed ones, add new ones
> 3. Update **TODO / Roadmap** — check off completed items
> 4. Fill in the **Session Handoff** section at the bottom
> 5. Commit and push:
> ```bash
> git add PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
> git commit -m "Update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md — [brief description]"
> git push origin main
> ```
>
> **Never:**
> - Delete existing Change Log entries
> - Overwrite credential values with placeholders
> - Rebuild a workflow or file that already exists without owner confirmation
> - Activate any workflow in n8n — activation is always Kai's decision
> - Commit API keys or .mcp.json to the repo

# Project Overview

**Project Name:** Business Agent Foundry — Phoenix Automation (First Live Implementation)

**Purpose:**
A system that generates fully operational business agents, workflows, SOPs, and operating systems from a structured business blueprint with minimal founder input. Phoenix Automation is the first live test case: an AI automation agency that delivers n8n workflow automation to small business clients.

**Problem It Solves:**
Building an AI automation agency requires hundreds of hours of manual setup. This system automates the entire operating layer — lead generation, qualification, onboarding, build, QA, reporting — so the founder focuses on sales and delivery quality, not operations.

**Team:**
| Person | Role | Contact |
|--------|------|---------|
| Kai Edwards | Founder — reviews, approves, activates | lightofkai777@gmail.com |
| Haris | VA — builds and tests under Kai's direction | — |

# Ownership & Responsibility

| Task Type | Owner | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Workflow activation in n8n | Kai only | Never activated by Haris or agents |
| Proposal sending | Kai only | Agent drafts, Kai sends |
| API key management | Kai | Shares keys directly — never committed to repo |
| Agent file creation/editing | Haris (with Kai review) | Always on feature branch, PR before merge |
| Workflow building in n8n | Haris (via Claude Code) | Uses workflow-builder-agent |
| QA execution | Haris | Reports results to Kai |
| Blueprint changes | Kai | Core system definition |
| Airtable schema changes | Either | Document in Change Log |

- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md added to repo root
- **n8n Cloud** — all 3 PA workflows imported to kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud (Business Foundry project)
- All workflow IDs updated to cloud IDs; broken connections and hardcoded PAT fixed post-import

## In Progress ⏳
- Default GitHub branch needs switching from `claude/setup-blueprint-agent-YnHBF` to `main` (Kai → Settings → Branches)
- Haris needs n8n Cloud access (Kai to invite)
- ClickUp API key expired — regenerate in ClickUp Settings, update `ClickUp account` credential (hLrtpicYXOOXrUh0) in n8n
- Typeform webhook is disabled (`enabled: false`) — Kai must activate [PA] Typeform Lead Qualification, then run Typeform webhook re-enable script (see Known Issues)

## Not Started ❌
- [PA] Outreach Agent workflow (blocked on Instantly.ai — needs sending account configured first)
- Error handling workflow (deferred from QA)
- Instantly.ai: add sending email account in Instantly UI (Settings → Email Accounts → Connect)
- Apollo.io paid plan — free plan blocks `/mixed_people/search`, Lead Gen is MOCK MODE
- Stripe webhook integration — payment confirmation currently manual

# Architecture

## Tech Stack
| Layer | Tool | Version | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| Workflow automation | n8n | 2.37.1 (Cloud — kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud) | All automated pipelines |
| AI agents | Claude Code | 2.1.77 | Agent execution, code generation |
| Anthropic API | claude-sonnet-4-6 | — | Model for all agent AI calls |
| Agent-to-n8n bridge | n8n-MCP | czlonkowski (local build) | Claude Code controls n8n via MCP |
| CRM / data layer | Airtable | — | Lead scoring, client tracking, delivery logs |
| Project management | ClickUp | — | Client project tracking per engagement |
| Email | Gmail SMTP | — | Onboarding emails, status updates |
| Lead sourcing | Apollo.io | — | ICP-matched prospect sourcing |
| Outreach sequencing | Instantly.ai | — | Cold email sequences — not yet set up |
| Version control | GitHub | — | All agent files, specs, SOPs, scopes |
| IDE | VS Code + Claude Code | — | Primary development environment |

## System Design

**Layer 1 — Blueprint Agent:** Converts raw founder input into a structured, validated business blueprint. Already complete — do not rebuild.

**Layer 2 — Agent Builder:** Reads a validated blueprint and generates the full operational stack. Already complete — do not rebuild.

**Delivery Pipeline:**
```
Lead Generation → Lead Qualification → Assessment → Process Mapping
→ Scoping → Proposal → Onboarding → Build → QA → Activation → Live
```

## Branching Strategy
```
main              ← stable, always deployable
phoenix/[task]    ← all new work goes here, PR before merging to main
```

# Environment Setup

## Kai's Machine
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| OS | macOS (Apple Silicon — arm64) |
| Node version | 20.20.1 (via nvm) |
| n8n version | 2.37.1 (Cloud — kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud) |
| Claude Code version | 2.1.77 (native install) |
| n8n-MCP location | `~/Documents/n8n-mcp/dist/mcp/index.js` |
| Repo location | `~/Documents/business-agent-foundry` |
| n8n URL | `https://kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud` |
| VPN required | Yes — US server (Atlanta/NordVPN) needed from Vietnam for Anthropic API |

## Haris's Machine
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| OS | Windows |
| Node version | 20.20.1 |
| Git version | 2.53.0 |
| Claude Code version | 2.1.76 |
| n8n access | ⏳ Pending n8n Cloud setup by Kai |
| Repo location | `D:\Projects\business-agent-foundry` |

## Session Startup Sequence (Kai)
```bash
# 1. Start n8n in one terminal tab (leave running)
n8n start

# 2. Open repo in VS Code
cd ~/Documents/business-agent-foundry
code .

# 3. Start Claude Code (in VS Code terminal)
claude
# → Select option 1 when prompted about MCP server

# 4. IMPORTANT — auth check
# If you see: "Auth conflict: Using ANTHROPIC_API_KEY instead of Console key"
# Run: unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# Then restart: claude

# 5. Smoke test
# Paste in Claude Code:
# Please read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md and confirm you have full project context.
# Then run: claude mcp list
# n8n-mcp should show (even if "Failed to connect" — that's a display bug, it works)
```

## Common Startup Errors
| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Auth conflict: Using ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Env var + Console login both active | `unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` then restart claude |
| `Request timed out` | VPN not on (from Vietnam) | Connect VPN to US server first |
| `n8n-mcp: Failed to connect` | Display bug — server actually works | Ignore, test with an actual MCP call |
| `zsh: command not found: claude` | PATH not set | `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc` |
| n8n won't start | Port 5678 in use | `lsof -i :5678` then kill the PID |

> ⚠️ **ClickUp API constraint (permanent):** The ClickUp v2 API does not support `POST /folder/{id}/folder`. Client folders CANNOT be nested inside Client Projects via API — they are always created at space root with `POST /space/{space_id}/folder`. The Client Projects folder (90147969224) is a manual organizational container only. Do not attempt to use `/folder/{id}/folder` — it returns 404.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always use table ID `tblfvqqyYukRJQYmQ`
Using `tblfvqqyYukRJQYmQYgdBXXCYhRqJ` (old/wrong ID) causes 403 Forbidden errors. This has burned time multiple times. Never use the long version.

# End-to-End Data Flow

```
1. LEAD GENERATION (daily 06:45) ✅ LIVE
   Apollo.io → ICP filter → dedup → write Prospects (outreach_status: pending) → log

2. OUTREACH (daily 07:00) ❌ NOT BUILT
   Read pending prospects → Claude generates email → Instantly.ai queue → update status

3. LEAD QUALIFICATION (inbound) ❌ NOT BUILT
   Typeform/chatbot → score → grade A/B = Calendly → write to Airtable

4. ASSESSMENT + PROCESS MAPPING (owner)
   Owner call → process-mapping-agent → docs/clients/[slug]/process-map.md

5. SCOPING + PROPOSAL (owner triggers)
   automation-scoping-agent → pricing tree → scope-of-work.md + proposal-draft.md → owner sends

6. PAYMENT → ONBOARDING ✅ LIVE
   Stripe webhook → [PA] Onboarding Automation
   → validate → slug → Airtable lookup → workspace name → credentials checklist
   → ClickUp project → update Airtable → owner summary email + client welcome email

7. BUILD (owner triggers)
   workflow-builder-agent + n8n-MCP → builds client's automations in n8n

8. QA (Haris runs)
   qa-agent 25-item checklist → PASS = owner activation checklist → FAIL = back to builder

9. ACTIVATION (Kai only — manual in n8n)

10. LIVE
    Status Update Agent → every Monday 09:00 → client email ✅ LIVE
    Reporting Agent → monthly → client report ❌ NOT BUILT
    Referral Trigger → day 30 → pa-smtp email_1 to client + email_2 draft to Kai ✅ BUILT (inactive)

# Recurring Bugs & Fixes Reference

> These bugs have appeared multiple times. Check here before debugging from scratch.

| Bug | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|-----|---------|-----------|-----|
| Airtable 403 Forbidden | `INVALID_PERMISSIONS_OR_MODEL_NOT_FOUND` | Wrong table ID (long version) | Use `tblfvqqyYukRJQYmQ` not the long version |
| Code node json error | `A 'json' property isn't an object` | Return not wrapped correctly | Always return `[{ json: { ...fields } }]` |
| IF node type error | `Wrong type: '' is a string but was expecting array` | Array operator on string field | Use Code node to set boolean flag, then IF checks string `"true"/"false"` |
| Blank emails | Email body renders empty | Claude HTML unpredictable format | Ask Claude for plain text sections, build HTML in Code node |
| Loop node stale state | Loop stops after first client | splitInBatches retains state | Clear `staticData` to null or replace with direct Code node processing |
| n8n timeout from Vietnam | `Request timed out` in Claude Code | High latency to Anthropic servers | Connect VPN to US server before starting Claude Code |
| Auth conflict timeout | `Auth conflict: Using ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Env var + Console login both active | `unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` then restart claude |
| Node reference error | `Referenced node doesn't exist` | Node was renamed/removed | Change all `$('Old Node Name')` references to `$json` |
| ClickUp Folder error | `Error fetching options from ClickUp` | Space has no folders | Toggle `Folderless List` ON in ClickUp node |
| n8n MCP "Failed to connect" | Health check shows failed | Display bug only | Ignore — test with actual MCP call to confirm it works |
| n8n repeated fields[] params not sent | Airtable returns only last field; all others empty | n8n HTTP Request node doesn't reliably send repeated query params with same key | Remove all fields[] restrictions — let Airtable return all fields; Code nodes read only what they need |
| record_id undefined after HTTP node | PATCH URL resolves to `/undefined`; flag node fails silently | HTTP Request node output = API response body, not input data — record_id is lost | Use `$('NodeName').item.json.record_id` to reach back to last Code node that had the field |
| ClickUp /folder/{id}/task 404 | `Route not found` from ClickUp API | `/folder/{id}/task` endpoint does not exist in ClickUp v2 | Use `/team/{team_id}/task?folder_ids[]={folder_id}` — PA team ID: `90141018999` |
| Airtable checkbox formula invalid | `INVALID_FILTER_BY_FORMULA` | `{field}=FALSE()` is not valid Airtable formula syntax | Use `NOT({field})` for unchecked checkbox filter |
| ClickUp nested folder creation fails | `Cannot POST /api/v2/folder/{id}/folder` | ClickUp v2 API does not support sub-folder creation — folders can only be created at space root | Always use `POST /api/v2/space/{space_id}/folder` — the Client Projects folder (90147969224) is a manual UI container only, not a parent via API |

# Decisions & Reasoning

| Decision | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| n8n self-hosted (local) | Free tier, full control, no enterprise features needed |
| n8n-MCP via local clone | npx download times out (500MB) from SE Asia — must clone and build locally |
| Hardcoded values, not n8n Variables | Variables is enterprise-only on community edition |
| n8n Projects stubbed (nodes 7+11) | `/api/v1/projects` returns 403 on community edition — replaced with Code nodes |
| pa- prefix for all credentials | Separates Phoenix Automation from FlowPilot in same n8n instance |
| Two email nodes in onboarding | Internal owner summary + client welcome serve different purposes |
| company_name \|\| client_name for slug | Stripe sends billing contact in client_name — company_name is more reliable for slug |
| Unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Claude Code | Env var + Console login simultaneously causes request timeouts |
| VPN (US server) required | Anthropic API latency from Vietnam exceeds Claude Code timeout threshold |
| Plain text → JS HTML for emails | Claude HTML output is unpredictable; Code node builds guaranteed structure |
| Folderless List for ClickUp node | Phoenix Automation space has no folders — lists are at space level directly |
| String comparison for IF dedup | n8n v2 IF node array operators are unreliable — string "true"/"false" is bulletproof |
| n8n Cloud for team access | n8n Projects requires enterprise on self-hosted; Cloud Starter (~$20/mo) supports 2 users |
| filterByFormula uses double quotes | Airtable rejects single quotes in formula strings — always use `{field}="value"` |

## Long-term
- [ ] Apollo.io paid plan for higher volume
- [ ] Generalize Agent Foundry for second business type

> **Client n8n model — DECIDED (2026-03-26):** Each client creates and owns their own n8n account. During credential collection (onboarding), the client shares their n8n API key and instance URL alongside their other tool credentials. The **Workflow Builder Agent** (automated — runs via n8n-MCP) then uses that API key to connect to the client's n8n instance and build their custom automations there automatically. This is Step 7 of the delivery pipeline. The `n8n_workspace_id` field in Airtable stores the client's n8n instance URL. The welcome email must include n8n account setup as a required credential step. "Client n8n API key in Airtable" is a hard prerequisite before the Workflow Builder Agent can run.

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-25 (Session 8 — continued)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **End-to-end systems test** — Steps 1–4 executed and verified:
  - Step 1: Prospect record `recd7jqEXed0v3oBe` created (Prospects table, `outreach_status=pending`)
  - Step 2: Client record `recNr32G2QJd5bbkw` created (Brightline Property Management / Sarah Chen)
  - Step 3: Onboarding Automation webhook triggered → execution 70 → **PASS** (all 6 Airtable fields written, ClickUp folder `90148085794` created)
  - Step 4: ClickUp folder ID confirmed in Airtable; list count unverifiable (ClickUp key expired mid-session)
- **Bug fix:** Corrected `service_tier` options in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md — `growth-package` → `growth-build` (plus added full option list)
- **QA report written:** `docs/clients/brightline-property-management/e2e-test-report.md`
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated:** version bump, Known Issues, TODO, session handoff

### What is in progress (not finished)
- Steps 5 and 6 of E2E test (Status Update Agent + Referral Trigger Agent) — test data is ready, waiting on manual execution from n8n editor

### Blockers for next session
- Haris not yet invited to n8n Cloud (Kai action required)
- Status Update Agent and Referral Trigger Agent cannot be triggered via API — must be run from n8n editor
- Instantly.ai not configured — Referral Trigger Agent will log stub, not send emails

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai:** Open n8n editor → run [PA] Status Update Agent manually → verify email sent to `muneebfiaz201@gmail.com`
3. **Kai:** Open n8n editor → run [PA] Referral Trigger Agent manually → verify `referral_sequence_sent=true` in Airtable + entry in `automation_logs`
4. **Kai/Haris:** Clean up Brightline test records (instructions in `docs/clients/brightline-property-management/e2e-test-report.md`)
5. **Haris (after n8n access):** Fix `onboarding_started_at` — add field to Node 21 of Onboarding Automation

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.4, service_tier options corrected, Known Issues + TODO updated, Session 8 handoff
- `docs/clients/brightline-property-management/e2e-test-report.md` — created (new)

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-27 (Session 10)
**Worked by:** Kai

### What was completed
- **[PA] Referral Trigger Agent E2E test — PASS** (all 6 steps complete)
  - Brightline record picked up by filter, Claude emails generated, Airtable flags written correctly
- **Referral Trigger Agent bugs fixed (5 bugs this session):**
  1. `{referral_sequence_sent}=FALSE()` → `NOT({referral_sequence_sent})` (invalid Airtable formula)
  2. `fields[]` query params removed from Fetch node — n8n doesn't reliably send repeated same-key params
  3. `record_id` lost after HTTP nodes — fixed with `$('Extract Referral Emails').item.json.record_id`
  4. `Split Client Records` had `|| ,` (missing fallback string) — fixed to `|| ''`
  5. `referral_sequence_sent_at` sent as ISO timestamp to date field — fixed with `.split('T')[0]`
- **Status Update Agent bugs fixed (3 bugs this session):**
  1. `Split Client Records` missing node name: `$().first()` → `$('Fetch Active Clients').first()`
  2. `Get All Tasks From Folder` URL: `/folder/{id}/task` (doesn't exist) → `/team/90141018999/task?folder_ids[]={id}`
  3. `Error Skip` rewritten to pass through client data + `tasks: []` so workflow continues on ClickUp error
- **pa-smtp** updated to kai@phoenixautomation.ai (Google Workspace, App Password)
- **Business updates:** Florida registration confirmed, EIN pending, Partnership Agreement sent to Howard
- **Client n8n model confirmed:** Option A — clients own their own n8n accounts
- Airtable test records cleaned up (Brightline + Prospects both set to test-complete)

### What is in progress (not finished)
- Reporting Agent: Fetch Executions node still has pa-anthropic credential (needs manual switch in editor)
- EIN application pending (document numbers required)
- Partnership Agreement awaiting Howard's signature

### Blockers for next session
- Outreach Agent blocked on Instantly.ai — needs PA domain first
- Onboarding flow needs updating for Option A client n8n model before first real client

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai:** Open Reporting Agent → Fetch Executions node → switch credential to pa-n8n-api → re-run test
3. **Kai:** Secure Phoenix Automation domain → set up Instantly.ai → then Haris builds Outreach Agent
4. **Before first real client:** Update Onboarding Automation for Option A (client self-serves n8n account)

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.7, E2E PASS, pa-smtp updated, 4 new recurring bugs, Session 10 handoff

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-26 (Session 9)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **FIX 1 — Meridian Consulting:** Status Test Client set to `test-complete`. Meridian ClickUp folder created (ID: `90148117751`) with 4 lists (Onboarding, Build, QA, Live). Airtable record updated with correct folder ID.
- **FIX 2 — Status Update Agent (94DpGwRPWGRPqCVU):** `Split Client Records` node now filters out clients with null/empty `clickup_folder_id`. `Get All Tasks From Folder` URL changed from team-level (`/team/{id}/task?folder_id[]=`) to folder-specific (`/folder/{id}/task`) — eliminates cross-team task bleed.
- **FIX 3 — Onboarding welcome email (7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM):** "I'll send exact instructions shortly" placeholder replaced with per-tool step-by-step instructions for: Airtable, Gmail, Calendly, QuickBooks, Buildium, Zapier, Typeform. Subject updated to "Action required: Set up your automation credentials". 5-business-day deadline added.
- **FIX 4 — `onboarding_started_at` (7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM):** Added to Node 21 (Update Airtable Record) jsonBody — now written as `new Date().toISOString()` on every onboarding run.
- **Root cause confirmed for email pollution:** Not Meridian (`project_status=lead`) — was `Status Test Client` with `project_status=live` and `clickup_folder_id=90147969224` (Client Projects parent folder, not a client folder). Fixed.
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated:** Known Issues resolved, TODO restructured, Session 9 handoff added.

### What is in progress (not finished)
- Step 6 of E2E test (Referral Trigger Agent) — Brightline test data still live and ready

### Blockers for next session
- Kai must run Referral Trigger Agent manually from n8n editor to complete Step 6
- Client n8n account model decision (Kai) — blocks Workflow Builder Agent scoping
- Haris not yet invited to n8n Cloud

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai:** Run [PA] Referral Trigger Agent from n8n editor — verify `referral_sequence_sent=true` on Brightline record (`recNr32G2QJd5bbkw`) + entry in `automation_logs`
3. **Kai:** Re-run [PA] Status Update Agent — verify clean email (only Brightline tasks, no PA internal tasks)
4. **Kai/Haris:** Clean up Brightline test records after Step 6 confirmed
5. **Kai:** Decide client n8n account model (Option A vs B) — reply to Haris so Workflow Builder Agent scope can be written

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.6, 4 Known Issues resolved, TODO restructured, Session 9 handoff
- `docs/clients/brightline-property-management/e2e-test-report.md` — updated Step 5 result + root cause, Step 6 instructions, bugs table expanded
- **n8n workflows updated (via API — no local file changes):**
  - `[PA] Status Update Agent` (94DpGwRPWGRPqCVU) — folder filter + endpoint fix
  - `[PA] Onboarding Automation` (7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM) — welcome email + onboarding_started_at

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-25 (Session 8 — Q&A + findings)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- [PA] Status Update Agent manually triggered by Haris from n8n editor — email received ✅
- Root cause identified for polluted Status Update email: Meridian Consulting still has `project_status=live` in Airtable — its ClickUp folder points to PA internal tasks, causing them to appear in client emails
- Three architectural gaps identified and documented:
  1. **Meridian Consulting pollution** — must set to `test-complete` immediately
  2. **Credential follow-up not automated** — "I'll send exact instructions shortly" in welcome email is placeholder text only; no follow-up workflow exists
  3. **Client n8n account model undecided** — Onboarding creates a stub label but doesn't provision a real n8n workspace for the client; decision needed before Workflow Builder Agent can be properly scoped
- Known Issues, TODO, and client n8n model note all updated in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

### What is in progress (not finished)
- [PA] Referral Trigger Agent manual test not yet done (Haris ran Status Update only this session)
- Brightline test records still live in Airtable — cleanup pending

### Blockers for next session
- Meridian Consulting `project_status` must be set to `test-complete` (Kai) before running any more Status Update tests
- Client n8n account model decision (Kai) blocks Workflow Builder Agent scoping and credential follow-up design
- Haris still not invited to n8n Cloud (Kai)

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai — do these first:**
   - Set Meridian Consulting `project_status = "test-complete"` in Airtable
   - Run [PA] Referral Trigger Agent from n8n editor → verify `referral_sequence_sent=true` on Brightline record + entry in `automation_logs`
   - Decide client n8n model: Option A (each client owns account) or Option B (all in Kai's account)
   - Update Calendly URL in workflow `ka6GesSfWVo2FZtU` node "Build Claude Payload"
3. **Haris (after Kai completes above):** Build automated credential follow-up email workflow, then [PA] Reporting Agent

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.5, 3 new Known Issues (Meridian pollution, credential gap, n8n model), TODO restructured with Kai urgency markers, client n8n note updated

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-24 (Session 7)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **[PA] Referral Trigger Agent** built via n8n API — ID: `ka6GesSfWVo2FZtU`, 13 nodes
  - Schedule trigger daily 08:00 + manual trigger
  - Fetches clients: `project_status=live`, `referral_sequence_sent_at=BLANK`, day 30 post-launch
  - Generates 2-touch referral email sequence via Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
  - Instantly.ai stubbed: logs `INSTANTLY_NOT_CONFIGURED` to `automation_logs` table
  - Sets `referral_sequence_sent_at` on completion (prevents re-firing)
  - False branch (no scope_of_work): also sets flag to prevent infinite daily re-check
- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated: workflow registry, TODO, Known Issues, session handoff

### What is in progress (not finished)
- [PA] Referral Trigger Agent not yet tested — Instantly.ai stub in place, Calendly URL needs updating before test

### Blockers for next session
- Haris not yet invited to n8n Cloud (Kai action required)
- Outreach Agent blocked on Instantly.ai account + pa-instantly credential

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai:** Invite Haris to n8n Cloud workspace
3. **Kai:** Update Calendly URL in [PA] Referral Trigger Agent — open workflow `ka6GesSfWVo2FZtU`, edit node "Build Claude Payload", replace `https://calendly.com/phoenixautomation/assessment` with real URL
4. **Kai:** Decide whether to add `automations_delivered` field to Airtable Clients table (currently uses `scope_of_work` as fallback)
5. **Kai:** Set up Instantly.ai account + domain — needed before Outreach Agent and Referral Trigger go live
6. **Haris (after n8n access):** QA all workflows visually in n8n Cloud editor, then build [PA] Reporting Agent

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.3, Referral Trigger added to registry, TODO/Known Issues updated, Session 7 handoff

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-01 (Session 13 — Full System Audit)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **Full live system audit** — queried n8n, Airtable, Instantly, Typeform APIs to verify every workflow, credential, and data layer
- **automation_logs Airtable** — added 4 missing fields: event (`fldLJJlsN4YaEwM1h`), client (`fldAN5uJmukAgaJM4`), notes (`fldszrHm2ZvTPlaMu`), timestamp (`fldQq93QdesxwZszk`) — newer workflows (Credential Follow-Up, ClickUp Sync) were silently failing to log properly
- **Clients table** — added `n8n_api_key` field (`fldxqbU9PIVvurgPl`) — required for workflow-builder-agent to connect to client n8n instances
- **Test data cleaned** — Alice Test, Bob Sample, Carol Demo prospects set to `test-complete`; "Test Company" client set to `closed.no_deal`
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md v4.0** — Known Issues, TODO, Airtable schema, workflow status all updated from audit findings

### Key audit findings (live API)
| Item | Finding |
|------|---------|
| n8n workflows | 8 built; 3 active (Onboarding, Lead Gen, Status Update); 5 inactive awaiting Kai activation |
| [PA] Outreach Agent | NOT BUILT — Instantly has 0 sending accounts |
| Error handling workflow | NOT BUILT |
| ClickUp API key | Expired (OAUTH_025) — all ClickUp Sync executions will fail until regenerated |
| Typeform webhook | Disabled — workflow inactive caused Typeform to auto-disable it |
| automation_logs | Was missing 4 fields — fixed this session |
| Instantly.ai | 0 sending accounts, 0 campaigns — unconfigured |
| Apollo.io | Free plan — Lead Gen is mock (3 synthetic contacts only) |

### Blockers for next session
- Kai must activate 4 workflows + regenerate ClickUp key before any of them can run
- Instantly sending account needed before Outreach Agent can be built
- Typeform webhook re-enable must happen after Typeform Lead Qual workflow is activated

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **KAI ACTIONS (in order):**
   a. Regenerate ClickUp API key → update n8n credential hLrtpicYXOOXrUh0
   b. Activate [PA] Typeform Lead Qualification (kXxN7O77ongTMwKG)
   c. Re-enable Typeform webhook: `PUT /forms/RSsWJkcf/webhooks/pa-n8n-intake` with `{"url":"https://kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/typeform-intake","enabled":true}` + Typeform Bearer token
   d. Activate [PA] Credential Follow-Up (uTnQAq5VlmsHYih4)
   e. Activate [PA] Referral Trigger Agent (ka6GesSfWVo2FZtU)
   f. Activate [PA] ClickUp Sync (uiTwYIUk6nIFwLtX) — after ClickUp key is updated
3. **KAI:** Set up Instantly sending account (Settings → Email Accounts → Connect in Instantly UI)
4. **Haris (after Instantly account):** Build [PA] Outreach Agent

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v4.0, audit findings, new Known Issues, Airtable schema updated
- **Airtable changes (via API):**
  - automation_logs: 4 fields added (event, client, notes, timestamp)
  - Clients: 1 field added (n8n_api_key)
  - Prospects: Alice, Bob, Carol set to test-complete
  - Clients: Test Company set to closed.no_deal

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-31 (Session 12)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **[PA] Onboarding Automation Node 49 updated** — subject changed to "Welcome to Phoenix Automation — action required before we can start"; new "Step 1 — Set up your n8n account" section inserted before "Your next steps" (n8n.io signup, API key creation, reply with URL + key); all 3 verification checks ✅
- **[PA] Credential Follow-Up built** — ID: `uTnQAq5VlmsHYih4`, 11 nodes, daily 10:00 + manual; fetches Airtable clients stalled >48h on onboarding.in_progress; IF skip if already flagged <24h; emails Kai with company/contact/hours overdue; PATCH overdue_flagged_at; logs to automation_logs; continueOnFail on all HTTP nodes; inactive
- **[PA] Typeform Lead Qualification built** — ID: `kXxN7O77ongTMwKG`, 13 nodes (prior session); Typeform webhook registered (tag: pa-n8n-intake, secret: pa-typeform-2026); Typeform form created (ID: RSsWJkcf)
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated** to v3.5 — Credential Follow-Up registered, node summary added, TODO items marked complete

### What is in progress (not finished)
- Gap analysis not yet run (was deferred from this session)

### Blockers for next session
- Outreach Agent still blocked on Instantly.ai
- Update Workflow Builder Agent scope: prerequisite — client n8n API key + instance URL in Airtable `n8n_workspace_id` before agent runs

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **KAI:** Activate [PA] Credential Follow-Up (`uTnQAq5VlmsHYih4`) — no dependencies, safe to activate immediately
3. **KAI:** Activate [PA] Typeform Lead Qualification (`kXxN7O77ongTMwKG`) — Typeform webhook is registered and ready
4. **KAI:** Update Calendly URL in Referral Trigger Agent (workflow `ka6GesSfWVo2FZtU`, node "Build Claude Payload")
5. **Haris:** Update Workflow Builder Agent scope — add prerequisite: client n8n API key + instance URL must be in Airtable before build starts
6. **Haris:** Full gap analysis of all project files (read-only — was deferred)

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v3.5, Credential Follow-Up registered, Node 49 update noted, 2 TODO items marked complete, session handoff
- **n8n workflows updated (via API — no local file changes):**
  - `[PA] Onboarding Automation` (7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM) — Node 49 subject + n8n setup section
  - `[PA] Credential Follow-Up` (uTnQAq5VlmsHYih4) — created new

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-24 (Session 6)
**Worked by:** Kai + Claude (Claude Code)

### What was completed
- n8n Cloud instance set up at kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud (Business Foundry project)
- All 3 PA workflows imported to cloud:
  - [PA] Onboarding Automation → `7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM`
  - [PA] Status Update Agent → `94DpGwRPWGRPqCVU`
  - [PA] Lead Generation → `YO3f5CL9bYbLTBgw`
- Post-import audit completed — found and fixed:
  1. Status Update Agent: 2 broken connections (Split Client Records → Get All Tasks From Folder; Get All Tasks From Folder → Merge/Error Skip)
  2. Onboarding Automation: hardcoded Airtable PAT in Update Airtable Record replaced with `predefinedCredentialType: airtableTokenApi`
- All credential bindings confirmed auto-linked on import (pa-airtable, pa-clickup, pa-smtp, pa-anthropic all resolved)
- No localhost URLs found in any workflow — all clean
- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated: cloud IDs, n8n URL, MCP path, version bump

### What is in progress (not finished)
- [PA] Status Update Agent not yet test-executed (n8n Cloud API has no direct execute endpoint for non-webhook workflows — test via editor)

### Blockers for next session
- Haris not yet invited to n8n Cloud (Kai action)
- Outreach Agent blocked on Instantly.ai account

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. Open n8n Cloud editor and run manual test of [PA] Status Update Agent (ensure Status Test Client has `project_status=live` and `clickup_folder_id=90147969224` first)
3. Invite Haris to n8n Cloud workspace

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.2, cloud IDs, n8n URL, MCP path, Session 6 handoff

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-22 (Session 5)
**Worked by:** Kai + Haris (via Claude Code)

### What was completed
- [PA] Onboarding Automation end-to-end test: **PASS** (execution 209)
  - ClickUp folder + 4 lists (Onboarding/Build/QA/Live) confirmed created
  - `clickup_folder_id` written to Airtable, both emails sent
- Bugs found and fixed during testing:
  1. ClickUp API v2 doesn't support nested folders — changed to `POST /api/v2/space/90144568071/folder` (space level)
  2. HTTP list creation nodes: wrong `jsonBody` expression format — fixed to plain JSON strings
  3. Airtable `filterByFormula` single-quote bug — fixed to double quotes
  4. `Extract Tools Required` hard error on empty tools — changed to graceful warn + 3-level fallback
- Discovered stable n8n API key: "FlowPilot OS" (no expiry). "phoenix-local" key has `exp` claim and is unreliable.
- Confirmed ClickUp API key: `pk_198267967_P2B3ZQTSNOTEJO5BVZ83PQBU3V0M3R2B` (from decrypted pa-clickup credential)
- Cleaned up test ClickUp folder (90147998711 deleted), Status Test Client Airtable record reset to test-complete
- Workflow deactivated after testing (as per project rules)

### Blockers for next session
- Haris does not have n8n access yet (Kai setting up n8n Cloud)
- Outreach Agent blocked on Instantly.ai
- Meridian test record has stale n8n workspace/credentials IDs — clean before first real client

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai:** Plan client n8n model session — onboarding flow needs updating before first real client
3. **Haris:** Build [PA] Reporting Agent once n8n Cloud access is ready

### Files changed this session
- `docs/clients/phoenix-automation/build-log.md` — updated [PA] Onboarding Automation status, node list, test results, bugs fixed

- `clickup_project_id` renamed to `clickup_folder_id` in Airtable + both workflows
- [PA] Onboarding Automation updated: replaces folderless list with folder + 4 lists (Onboarding, Build, QA, Live). Now 24 nodes.
- [PA] Status Update Agent updated: reads all tasks from folder via team API (`folder_id[]` param). Now 15 nodes.

### Blockers for next session
- Haris does not have n8n access yet (Kai setting up n8n Cloud)

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-27 (Session 11)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **FIX 1 — ClickUp space renamed** to "Phoenix Automation" (color #1B2A4A) — space 90144568071
- **FIX 2 — Client folders recreated with full task seeding:**
  - Deleted stale root-level folders (old BPM 90148085794, old MCG 90148117751)
  - Created brightline-property-management (90148144284) + 4 lists + 7 tasks seeded
  - Created meridian-consulting-group (90148144286) + 4 lists + 7 tasks seeded
  - ⚠️ ClickUp v2 API limitation confirmed: `POST /folder/{id}/folder` returns 404 — folders must be created at space root, not nested under Client Projects. Documented in Recurring Bugs.
- **FIX 3 — Airtable: 4 new fields added** (clickup_list_onboarding/build/qa/live) and Brightline + Meridian records updated with all new IDs
- **FIX 4 — Onboarding Automation updated** (24 → 31 nodes):
  - Nodes 19–25: 7 task seeding HTTP POST nodes (auto-seeds tasks into all 4 lists)
  - Node 26 (Merge ClickUp Folder ID): now captures all 4 list IDs alongside folder ID
  - Node 27 (Log ClickUp Error): now sets all 4 list IDs to null on error path
  - Node 28 (Update Airtable Record): now writes clickup_list_onboarding/build/qa/live + onboarding_started_at
- **FIX 5 — Airtable cleanup:**
  - Deleted 3 blank/junk rows (rec7XfoO4a8sjZFTW, recWakBWZEMEu2wG2, reczHE2U5O52aB6Sd)
  - Status Test Client: slug fixed to "status-test-client", clickup_folder_id cleared
- **Welcome email fix** (from Session 10 continuation): removed "reply with credentials" CTA, added security notice, welcome + follow-up framing
- **Full ClickUp audit completed:** space structure, workflow node audit, Airtable field audit, edge case analysis — all documented
- **Calendly clarified:** API key not needed for current scope — webhook-only integration sufficient
- **Instantly.ai API key received** (MWFiM2VjZjMtYWEwYy00YWQ1LWEzYTMtNWNkOWMwYzc5MmViOmFVSkNIYlFSbGNlbQ==) — pa-instantly credential ready to set up
- **Session 11 continuation (same date):**
  - Tested ClickUp list template `t-901414909247` — confirmed template does NOT auto-seed tasks (both test lists created via `template_id` param had `task_count: 0`). Decision: keep 31-node workflow with individual task seeding as-is.
  - Deleted 4 lists: 2 template test lists (901414909658, 901414909660) + 2 stale space-root lists (meridian-consulting-group 901414583912, ashley-edwards 901414584147)
  - Status Update Agent TASK URL verified: `folder_ids[]` (with 's') — correct. Fixed typo in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md description (was `folder_id[]`).

### What is in progress (not finished)
- Referral Trigger Agent E2E Step 6 still pending — Brightline is test-complete so filter returns empty. Kai needs to temporarily set to `live`, run the agent, then revert.
- Reporting Agent: Fetch Executions node credential needs switching to pa-n8n-api

### Blockers for next session
- Brightline referral test: must temporarily set `project_status=live` to test
- Instantly.ai credential: set up pa-instantly in n8n before Outreach/Referral agents can send live emails

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai:** Set up pa-instantly credential in n8n using key MWFiM2VjZjMtYWEwYy00YWQ1LWEzYTMtNWNkOWMwYzc5MmViOmFVSkNIYlFSbGNlbQ==
3. **Kai:** Set Brightline `project_status=live` → run Referral Trigger Agent → verify → revert to test-complete
4. **Kai:** Set up Calendly webhook → paste n8n webhook URL in Calendly → Integrations → Webhooks (no API key needed)
5. **Haris:** Build [PA] Reporting Agent (scope ready in docs/workflows/build-scopes/)
6. **Haris:** Build automated credential collection follow-up email workflow (unblocked)

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.9, template test conclusion, 4 stale lists deleted, Status Update Agent URL typo fixed, Session 11 continuation handoff

  - IF Has Comment → POST ClickUp Comment ("Weekly status email sent to client — [date]")

- **Verification passed:**
  - All 6 parts verified via API checks
  - ClickUp Sync test: test-complete excluded ✅, live status included ✅
  - Brightline restored to test-complete ✅

### What is in progress (not finished)
- project_status singleSelect: ✅ RESOLVED — all 11 new values added via typecast:true
- [PA] ClickUp Sync: built and verified but not activated — Kai's decision
