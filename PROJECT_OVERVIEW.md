> ## AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — READ THIS FIRST
>
> **At the start of every session:**
> 1. Read this entire file before doing anything else
> 2. Use the API credentials, table IDs, field names, and workflow IDs here as ground truth — do not guess or fetch from external sources unless this file says a value is missing
> 3. Check Current Status before building anything — do not rebuild what already exists
> 4. Run the smoke test to confirm your environment is connected
>
> **At the end of every session:**
> 1. Update this file ONCE at the end of the session — not after every task
> 2. Update **Known Issues** — resolve fixed ones, add new ones
> 3. Update **TODO / Roadmap** — check off completed items
> 4. Fill in the **Session Handoff** section at the bottom
> 5. Commit and push:
> ```bash
> git add PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
> git commit -m "Update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md — [brief description]"
> git push origin main
> ```
>
> **Never:**
> - Delete existing Change Log entries
> - Overwrite credential values with placeholders
> - Rebuild a workflow or file that already exists without owner confirmation
> - Activate any workflow in n8n — activation is always Kai's decision
> - Commit API keys or .mcp.json to the repo

# Project Overview

**Project Name:** Business Agent Foundry — Phoenix Automation (First Live Implementation)

**Purpose:**
A system that generates fully operational business agents, workflows, SOPs, and operating systems from a structured business blueprint with minimal founder input. Phoenix Automation is the first live test case: an AI automation agency that delivers n8n workflow automation to small business clients.

**Problem It Solves:**
Building an AI automation agency requires hundreds of hours of manual setup. This system automates the entire operating layer — lead generation, qualification, onboarding, build, QA, reporting — so the founder focuses on sales and delivery quality, not operations.

**Team:**
| Person | Role | Contact |
|--------|------|---------|
| Kai Edwards | Founder — reviews, approves, activates | kai@phoenixautomation.ai |
| Haris | VA — builds and tests under Kai's direction | — |

# Ownership & Responsibility

| Task Type | Owner | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Workflow activation in n8n | Kai only | Never activated by Haris or agents |
| Proposal sending | Kai only | Agent drafts, Kai sends |
| API key management | Kai | Shares keys directly — never committed to repo |
| Agent file creation/editing | Haris (with Kai review) | Always on feature branch, PR before merge |
| Workflow building in n8n | Haris (via Claude Code) | Uses workflow-builder-agent |
| QA execution | Haris | Reports results to Kai |
| Blueprint changes | Kai | Core system definition |
| Airtable schema changes | Either | Document in Change Log |

- **[PA] Onboarding Automation** (7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM) — 58 nodes — rebuilt prospect→client flow 2026-04-22 and patched 2026-04-24: Create Airtable Client Record sends the proper JSON body, stale scope/prospect references were removed, n8n + ClickUp credentials are corrected, ClickUp error path is hardened, summary notifications route to kai@phoenixautomation.ai, and safe smoke test PASS execution 1599 created Client `recBZSa9WsYabJawm` + ClickUp folder `90148889216`.
- **[PA] Lead Generation** (YO3f5CL9bYbLTBgw) — 13 nodes, Apollo.io paid plan — patched 2026-04-27: Apollo bulk enrichment restored to max batch size 10, empty/debug enrichment outputs blocked from Airtable writes, run summaries now log found/added/skipped counts. Latest manual execution 2567 PASS: 56 found, 9 added.
- **[PA] Morning Brief Delivery** (EKKXeBCEiKXaYBCx) — ACTIVE — daily morning brief workflow, confirmed active 2026-04-20
- **[PA] Outreach Agent** (Mib6RUtJ2IOaUZ4s) — 51 nodes — rebuilt 2026-04-21, active; patched 2026-04-27 so Split in Batches loop branches feed Email 2, Email 3, completion, and reply handling correctly. Email 2 backlog moved to `email_2_sent` after manual run; latest execution 2588 PASS.
- **[PA] Status Update Agent** (94DpGwRPWGRPqCVU) — 20 nodes, active; branded weekly client status emails working; ClickUp sync/comment nodes added.
- **[PA] Referral Trigger Agent** (ka6GesSfWVo2FZtU) — 16 nodes, active; uses pa-smtp directly (referral email to client, Day 7 draft/notification to Kai at kai@phoenixautomation.ai).
- **[PA] ClickUp Sync** (uiTwYIUk6nIFwLtX) — 18 nodes, active; syncs Airtable `project_status` to ClickUp task statuses every 2 hours. Patched 2026-04-27: Split in Batches loop branches corrected and task-update splitting fixed. Latest execution 2584 PASS/logged.
- **[PA] Reporting Agent** (scj61gBYYWpQydMC) — 17 nodes, inactive; monthly retainer reports via Claude → client email → Airtable update; sender/reply-to patched to kai@phoenixautomation.ai; activate after first retainer client is live.
- **[PA] Typeform Lead Qualification** (kXxN7O77ongTMwKG) — 14 nodes, active; Typeform submission → answer extraction → dedup → Prospects write → Claude score via Anthropic HTTP → Kai notification for Grade A/B leads at kai@phoenixautomation.ai. Safe smoke test PASS execution 1595.
- **[PA] Credential Follow-Up** (uTnQAq5VlmsHYih4) — 11 nodes, active; daily 10:00 + manual → fetches onboarding.in_progress clients stalled >48h → alerts Kai at kai@phoenixautomation.ai → updates overdue_flagged_at → logs to automation_logs. Loop branch wiring patched 2026-04-27; latest execution 2416 PASS/no stalled clients.
- **[PA] Credential Detector** (hbtSbm2pzrHX1QTn) — 10 nodes, active; every 2h + manual → fetches onboarding.in_progress clients whose n8n_api_key is populated → sets project_status=build.ready → alerts Kai at kai@phoenixautomation.ai → logs to automation_logs. Loop branch wiring patched 2026-04-27; latest execution 2586 PASS/no new credentials.
- **[PA] Website Chatbot** (EPMCxdqKOuwc6hzB) — 15 nodes, built 2026-04-03, fully operational 2026-04-10 — webhook POST /website-chatbot → stateless 3-question chatbot → Claude scores lead (HTTP Request node, not Langchain) → hot: writes Airtable Prospect + returns Calendly link; cold: returns nurture message; borderline: asks clarifying question. Live on phoenixautomation.ai with auto-popup (7s teaser, 13s auto-open). End-to-end verified: hot lead record recRypnI7vsMlisJR created in Airtable Prospects.
- **3 new Airtable Prospects fields added** — `biggest_operational_pain` (long text), `lead_score_grade` (text), `lead_source` (text) — 2026-04-10; field names aligned to chatbot n8n node output
- **[PA] Scoping Agent** (E24KwVMam1e8bbjT) — 16 nodes, updated 2026-04-27 — reads/writes **Prospects table**, uses Anthropic HTTP instead of rate-limited OpenRouter, writes Airtable-safe JSON, maps service_tier to valid Prospects values, normalizes tools_required text, sets `project_status=scope_review`, and has corrected loop branch wiring. Latest execution 2587 PASS/no pending clients.
- **[PA] Scope Approval** (UB6ZdrnYpJlYfxD4) — 8 nodes, active; reads/writes Prospects table, locks approved scope, saves proposal_draft to Airtable as source of truth, creates a ClickUp Lead Management review task in parallel, emails Kai at kai@phoenixautomation.ai, and safe smoke test PASS execution 1598.
- **[PA] Workflow Builder Agent** (fy8OuUEGyyWhYzWC) — 21 nodes, inactive by design; polls build.ready clients hourly/manual → reads full Client scope from Airtable → Claude generates n8n workflow JSON → deploys to the client's n8n via `n8n_workspace_id` + `n8n_api_key` → sets `build.in_progress` on start and `build.complete` with deployed workflow IDs on completion → emails Kai for review. Patched 2026-04-27; activate only when a real build.ready client exists.
- **[PA] Scoping Notifier** (nXXsF4E1BPWIS62r) — 13 nodes, active; notifies Kai at kai@phoenixautomation.ai when a prospect is ready for scoping and exposes GET /trigger-scoping for browser-triggered handoff to Scoping Agent.
- **15 new Airtable Clients fields added** — call_notes, scope_summary, automation_count, automation_1/2/3_name, automation_1/2/3_description, scope_locked_at, proposal_draft, workflows_deployed, build_review_url — 2026-04-03

- **Mock client created** — docs/clients/sarahs-wellness-studio/ (process-map.md + scope-of-work.md) — Typeform program admission use case, ready for workflow-builder-agent test run
- **Chat embed widget** — docs/website-chatbot-embed.html — copy/paste snippet for Framer/Webflow/any website; calls /webhook/website-chatbot
- **[PA] Onboarding Automation Node 49** updated 2026-03-31 — subject changed to "Welcome to Phoenix Automation — action required before we can start"; n8n account setup section inserted before "Your next steps" (step-by-step: sign up at n8n.io, create API key named "Phoenix Automation", reply with instance URL + key)
- **[PA] Onboarding Automation** (7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM) — 58 nodes — rebuilt prospect→client flow 2026-04-22 and patched 2026-04-24: Create Airtable Client Record sends the proper JSON body, stale scope/prospect references were removed, n8n + ClickUp credentials are corrected, ClickUp error path is hardened, summary notifications route to kai@phoenixautomation.ai, and safe smoke test PASS execution 1599.
- **[PA] Status Update Agent** updated to 20 nodes — 5 new ClickUp sync nodes (determine task + PUT complete + POST comment) — 2026-03-27
- **28 new Airtable Clients fields added** — 21 clickup_task_* task ID fields + 7 supporting fields (workflows_built, qa_verdict, overdue_flagged_at, build_started_at, build_completed_at, qa_started_at, qa_completed_at) — 2026-03-27

- **pa-smtp** updated to kai@phoenixautomation.ai (Google Workspace, App Password) — 2026-03-27
- Haris has full n8n Cloud access (kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud) — confirmed 2026-03-27
- Google Workspace confirmed active — kai@phoenixautomation.ai and howard@phoenixautomation.ai
- Business registered in Florida; EIN pending document numbers
- Partnership Agreement drafted and sent to Howard Littel
- Client n8n model confirmed: Option A — each client owns their own n8n account
- client_timezone + last_status_update_sent_at fields added to Clients table
- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md added to repo root
- **n8n Cloud** — all 3 PA workflows imported to kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud (Business Foundry project)
- All workflow IDs updated to cloud IDs; broken connections and hardcoded PAT fixed post-import

## In Progress ⏳
- Default GitHub branch needs switching from `claude/setup-blueprint-agent-YnHBF` to `main` (Kai → Settings → Branches)
- Airtable PAT `patIwbtd9ndSoj2fJ...` was in local git history (test_outreach.js, now deleted) — rotate this token in Airtable account settings

## Live Audit Snapshot — 2026-04-27
- Full n8n/Airtable/ClickUp API audit completed at `2026-04-27T16:08:47Z`; all 17 `[PA]` workflows are present and all structural audit warnings are resolved.
- Active workflows: Onboarding, Lead Generation, Outreach, Status Update, Referral Trigger, ClickUp Sync, Typeform Lead Qualification, Credential Follow-Up, Credential Detector, Website Chatbot, Scoping Agent, Scope Approval, Scoping Notifier, Morning Brief Delivery, Error Handler.
- Inactive by design: Reporting Agent (`scj61gBYYWpQydMC`) until first retainer client is live; Workflow Builder Agent (`fy8OuUEGyyWhYzWC`) until a real `build.ready` client exists.
- Current Clients table contains one legacy/test client: Meridian Consulting Group (`rectfzSFPqjRQU4u1`), `project_status=scoping`, ClickUp folder `90148144286` (`meridian-consulting-group`), no `clickup_task_*` IDs, no `n8n_api_key`.
- Acme Test Co (`recIn0wyE44pjUL4O`) was removed from Airtable Clients on 2026-04-27. Its stored ClickUp folder ID pointed to `brightline-property-management`, so that ClickUp folder was intentionally left untouched.
- AI model policy: use Claude for external/client-facing copy, proposals, scoping, reporting, workflow generation, and final lead decisions. Free OpenRouter/GLM models are acceptable only for internal low-risk classification, extraction, routing, or rough summaries with deterministic validation.

## Not Started ❌
- Stripe webhook integration — payment confirmation currently manual

| Repo location | `~/Documents/business-agent-foundry` |
| n8n URL | `https://kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud` |
| VPN required | Yes — US server (Atlanta/NordVPN) needed from Vietnam for Anthropic API |

## Haris's Machine
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| OS | Windows |
| Node version | 20.20.1 |
| Git version | 2.53.0 |

| n8n access | ✅ kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud (confirmed 2026-04-20) |
| Repo location | `D:\Projects\business-agent-foundry` |

## Session Startup Sequence (Kai)
```bash
# 1. Start n8n in one terminal tab (leave running)
n8n start

# 2. Open repo in VS Code
cd ~/Documents/business-agent-foundry
code .

# 3. Start Claude Code (in VS Code terminal)
claude
# → Select option 1 when prompted about MCP server

# 4. IMPORTANT — auth check
# If you see: "Auth conflict: Using ANTHROPIC_API_KEY instead of Console key"
# Run: unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# Then restart: claude

# 5. Smoke test
# Paste in Claude Code:
# Please read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md and confirm you have full project context.
# Then run: claude mcp list
# n8n-mcp should show (even if "Failed to connect" — that's a display bug, it works)
```

## Common Startup Errors
| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Auth conflict: Using ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Env var + Console login both active | `unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` then restart claude |
| `Request timed out` | VPN not on (from Vietnam) | Connect VPN to US server first |
| `n8n-mcp: Failed to connect` | Display bug — server actually works | Ignore, test with an actual MCP call |
| `zsh: command not found: claude` | PATH not set | `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc` |
| n8n won't start | Port 5678 in use | `lsof -i :5678` then kill the PID |

> **Live audit 2026-04-24:** No folderless lists exist in the Phoenix Automation space. Internal currently has Lead Management (3 tasks), Operations (3 tasks), and Outreach (0 tasks). Two test client folders exist at space root with Onboarding/Build/QA/Live lists.

> ⚠️ **ClickUp API constraint (permanent):** The ClickUp v2 API does not support `POST /folder/{id}/folder`. Client folders CANNOT be nested inside Client Projects via API — they are always created at space root with `POST /space/{space_id}/folder`. The Client Projects folder (90147969224) is a manual organizational container only. Do not attempt to use `/folder/{id}/folder` — it returns 404.

### [PA] Website Chatbot (EPMCxdqKOuwc6hzB) — 15 nodes
```
Webhook URL: https://kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/website-chatbot
Input: POST { session_id, step (0–3), business_type, team_size, pain_description }
Output: JSON { message, next_step, done, route?, calendly_url? }

1.  Chatbot Webhook (Webhook — POST /website-chatbot, responseMode: responseNode)
2.  Route by Step (Switch — routes on step value 0/1/2/3)
3.  Greeting Response (Set — step=0, returns opening question)
4.  Question 2 Response (Set — step=1, asks team size)
5.  Question 3 Response (Set — step=2, asks biggest pain)
6.  Send Early Step Response (Respond to Webhook — returns message + next_step for steps 0–2)
7.  Score Lead via Claude (HTTP POST → Anthropic API /v1/messages, pa-anthropic HTTP Header Auth
    — prompt includes all 3 answers, returns JSON { route, pain_summary, clarifying_question }
    — uses $json.body?.pain_description || $json.body?.pain_point as fallback, step=3 only
    ⚠️ NOTE: was originally a Langchain AI node — replaced 2026-04-10 because Langchain nodes require
    "Anthropic API" credential type; pa-anthropic is "HTTP Header Auth" — incompatible)
8.  Parse Claude Score (Code — reads $input.first().json.content?.[0]?.text, strips markdown fences,
    parses JSON, extracts route/pain_summary/clarifying_question, merges with prospect context)
9.  IF Hot Lead (IF — route = "hot")
10. Write Hot Prospect to Airtable (HTTP POST → Airtable Prospects tbluEsKoQ2p49ktVq,

    outreach_status=pending, pa-airtable, continueOnFail)
11. Hot Response Data (Set — returns Calendly URL + personalised message referencing pain_summary)
12. IF Borderline (IF — route = "borderline")
13. Borderline Response Data (Set — returns clarifying_question from Claude)
14. Cold Response Data (Set — returns nurture message with kai@phoenixautomation.ai contact)
15. Send Response (Respond to Webhook — returns final JSON with CORS headers)

Embed widget: docs/website-chatbot-embed.html — copy/paste before </body> tag
Website widget features (live on phoenixautomation.ai):
- Orange bubble (#E8520A) matching brand
- Auto-popup teaser at 7s, auto-open at 13s
- Local greeting (no n8n call for step 0 — avoids timing errors)
- Close button in chat header
- Calendly links made clickable automatically
```

### [PA] Scoping Notifier (nXXsF4E1BPWIS62r) — 14 nodes
```
Two independent paths in one workflow:

1.  Poll Every 5 Minutes (Schedule Trigger — */5 * * * *)
2.  Manual Trigger
3.  Fetch call_complete Prospects (HTTP GET → Airtable Prospects, filter: project_status=call_complete
    AND scoping_notified_at="" AND call_notes!="", maxRecords=10, pa-airtable)
4.  IF Has Prospects (IF — records.length > 0)
5.  Exit — No Pending (NoOp — FALSE branch)
6.  Split Prospect Records (Code — flattens records array, one item per prospect)
7.  Loop Over Prospects (splitInBatches, batch=1)

9.  Mark Notified (HTTP PATCH → Airtable Prospects record, scoping_notified_at=now, pa-airtable)
    → loops back to Node 7

PATH B — One-click trigger (Kai clicks button → Claude scopes automatically):
10. Trigger Scoping Webhook (Webhook — GET /trigger-scoping?client_slug=X, responseMode: responseNode)
11. Fetch Prospect by Slug (HTTP GET → Airtable Prospects, filterByFormula={client_slug}="X", pa-airtable)
12. Extract Prospect (Code — extracts record_id, company_name, client_slug, industry, call_notes, prospect_name)
13. Trigger Scope-Call Webhook (HTTP POST → /webhook/scope-call with all prospect data)
14. Respond — Scoping Started (respondToWebhook → branded HTML success page "✅ Scoping Started for [Company]")
```

# End-to-End Data Flow

```
1. LEAD GENERATION (daily 06:45) ✅ LIVE
   Apollo.io → ICP filter → dedup → write Prospects (outreach_status: pending) → log

2. OUTREACH (daily 07:00) ✅ ACTIVE — 5-branch SMTP multi-step sequence
   pending → Email 1 (immediate) → Email 2 (after 1 day) → Email 3 (after 2 days) → Completed (after 7 days)
   IMAP reply detection → blocks follow-ups on reply → notifies Kai → updates ClickUp Outreach list

3. LEAD QUALIFICATION (inbound) ✅ BUILT (inactive — Kai activates)
   Typeform webhook → score via Claude → grade A/B = email Kai → write to Airtable Prospects

4. ASSESSMENT + PROCESS MAPPING (owner)
   Owner call → Kai sets Prospect project_status=call_complete + fills call_notes field in Airtable
   → [PA] Scoping Notifier detects within 5 min → emails Kai with prospect details + "Start Scoping Now" button

5. SCOPING + PROPOSAL ✅ UPDATED 2026-04-22
   Scoping Agent polls Prospects for project_status=call_complete → Claude generates scope →
   writes scope_of_work, scope_summary, service_tier, automation_1/2/3, tools_required to **Prospects** →
   sets project_status=scope_review → emails Kai with Approve button
   Kai clicks approve → Scope Approval reads/writes **Prospects** → locks scope_locked_at →
   Claude generates proposal_draft → saves to Prospects → emails Kai → project_status=proposal_sent

6. PAYMENT → ONBOARDING ✅ REBUILT 2026-04-22
   Stripe webhook → [PA] Onboarding Automation
   → validate → slug
   → **Lookup Prospect by email** (gets ALL data: qualification + scope + proposal)
   → **Create NEW Clients record** (copies all prospect + scope fields across, project_status=onboarding)
   → workspace stub → credentials checklist → ClickUp project → update Airtable (workspace/ClickUp IDs)
   → owner summary email + client welcome email
   → **mark Prospect outreach_status=completed** (prospect_record_id from Merge Airtable Context)
   → refresh Scoping Agent slug dropdown

7. BUILD (owner triggers)
   workflow-builder-agent + n8n-MCP → builds client's automations in n8n

8. QA (Haris runs)
   qa-agent 25-item checklist → PASS = owner activation checklist → FAIL = back to builder

9. ACTIVATION (Kai only — manual in n8n)

10. LIVE
    Status Update Agent → every Monday 09:00 → client email ✅ LIVE
    Reporting Agent → monthly → client report ❌ NOT BUILT
    Referral Trigger → day 30 → pa-smtp email_1 to client + email_2 draft to Kai ✅ BUILT (inactive)
```

# Recurring Bugs & Fixes Reference

> These bugs have appeared multiple times. Check here before debugging from scratch.

| Bug | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|-----|---------|-----------|-----|
| Airtable 403 Forbidden | `INVALID_PERMISSIONS_OR_MODEL_NOT_FOUND` | Wrong table ID (long version) | Use `tblfvqqyYukRJQYmQ` not the long version |
| Code node json error | `A 'json' property isn't an object` | Return not wrapped correctly | Always return `[{ json: { ...fields } }]` |
| IF node type error | `Wrong type: '' is a string but was expecting array` | Array operator on string field | Use Code node to set boolean flag, then IF checks string `"true"/"false"` |
| Blank emails | Email body renders empty | Claude HTML unpredictable format | Ask Claude for plain text sections, build HTML in Code node |
| Loop node stale state | Loop stops after first client | splitInBatches retains state | Clear `staticData` to null or replace with direct Code node processing |
| n8n timeout from Vietnam | `Request timed out` in Claude Code | High latency to Anthropic servers | Connect VPN to US server before starting Claude Code |
| Auth conflict timeout | `Auth conflict: Using ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Env var + Console login both active | `unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` then restart claude |
| Node reference error | `Referenced node doesn't exist` | Node was renamed/removed | Change all `$('Old Node Name')` references to `$json` |
| ClickUp Folder error | `Error fetching options from ClickUp` | Space has no folders | Toggle `Folderless List` ON in ClickUp node |
| n8n MCP "Failed to connect" | Health check shows failed | Display bug only | Ignore — test with actual MCP call to confirm it works |
| n8n repeated fields[] params not sent | Airtable returns only last field; all others empty | n8n HTTP Request node doesn't reliably send repeated query params with same key | Remove all fields[] restrictions — let Airtable return all fields; Code nodes read only what they need |
| record_id undefined after HTTP node | PATCH URL resolves to `/undefined`; flag node fails silently | HTTP Request node output = API response body, not input data — record_id is lost | Use `$('NodeName').item.json.record_id` to reach back to last Code node that had the field |
| ClickUp /folder/{id}/task 404 | `Route not found` from ClickUp API | `/folder/{id}/task` endpoint does not exist in ClickUp v2 | Use `/team/{team_id}/task?folder_ids[]={folder_id}` — PA team ID: `90141018999` |
| Airtable checkbox formula invalid | `INVALID_FILTER_BY_FORMULA` | `{field}=FALSE()` is not valid Airtable formula syntax | Use `NOT({field})` for unchecked checkbox filter |
| ClickUp nested folder creation fails | `Cannot POST /api/v2/folder/{id}/folder` | ClickUp v2 API does not support sub-folder creation — folders can only be created at space root | Always use `POST /api/v2/space/{space_id}/folder` — the Client Projects folder (90147969224) is a manual UI container only, not a parent via API |
| Langchain AI node fails with HTTP Header Auth credential | `Credentials of type anthropicApi are not supported` | n8n Langchain AI nodes require "Anthropic API" credential type. `pa-anthropic` is "HTTP Header Auth" — works for HTTP Request nodes but NOT Langchain nodes | Replace Langchain AI nodes with HTTP Request nodes pointing to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` with `pa-anthropic` credential. Parse response via `$input.first().json.content?.[0]?.text` |
| Remote Claude Code session blocks n8n API calls | n8n API calls time out or fail silently | Claude Code web/remote sessions run behind an egress proxy that only allows specific domains. `kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud` is not in the allowlist | All n8n workflow changes must be made via Python scripts run locally in Kai's VS Code terminal |
| Email HTML expressions render as literal text | Email body shows `={{ $("Node").item.json.field }}` as plain text | Two causes: (1) HTML field starts with `=` (expression mode) but contains `={{ }}` inline — the `=` inside is literal; (2) Fixed mode HTML with `={{ }}` — `=` is always literal text. n8n expression syntax inside HTML should be `{{ expr }}` only, never `={{ expr }}` | Strip `=` from HTML field start (use Fixed mode) and replace all `={{ ` with `{{ ` inside the HTML body |
| Merge node blocks when one upstream branch has 0 items | Workflow hangs indefinitely; downstream nodes never run | n8n Merge node waits for input from ALL connected upstreams. If a Switch/IF routes all items to one path, the other path produces 0 items and Merge never fires | Remove the Merge node. Connect all upstream paths directly to the first downstream node (a Code/HTTP node runs independently for each upstream that has items) |
| emailSend output replaces $json — upstream data lost | `$json.record_id` undefined after email node; PATCH URL resolves to `/undefined` | emailSend node outputs SMTP response (envelope, accepted, messageId etc.) as `$json` — any prior item fields are gone | Reference upstream node directly: `$('Loop Node Name').item.json.record_id` or `$('Code Node').item.json.field` |

# Decisions & Reasoning

| Decision | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| n8n self-hosted (local) | Free tier, full control, no enterprise features needed |
| n8n-MCP via local clone | npx download times out (500MB) from SE Asia — must clone and build locally |
| Hardcoded values, not n8n Variables | Variables is enterprise-only on community edition |
| n8n Projects stubbed (nodes 7+11) | `/api/v1/projects` returns 403 on community edition — replaced with Code nodes |
| pa- prefix for all credentials | Separates Phoenix Automation from FlowPilot in same n8n instance |
| Two email nodes in onboarding | Internal owner summary + client welcome serve different purposes |
| company_name \|\| client_name for slug | Stripe sends billing contact in client_name — company_name is more reliable for slug |
| Unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Claude Code | Env var + Console login simultaneously causes request timeouts |
| VPN (US server) required | Anthropic API latency from Vietnam exceeds Claude Code timeout threshold |
| Plain text → JS HTML for emails | Claude HTML output is unpredictable; Code node builds guaranteed structure |
| Folderless List for ClickUp node | Phoenix Automation space has no folders — lists are at space level directly |
| String comparison for IF dedup | n8n v2 IF node array operators are unreliable — string "true"/"false" is bulletproof |
| n8n Cloud for team access | n8n Projects requires enterprise on self-hosted; Cloud Starter (~$20/mo) supports 2 users |
| filterByFormula uses double quotes | Airtable rejects single quotes in formula strings — always use `{field}="value"` |

| Instantly.ai has 0 sending accounts | Blocks Outreach Agent entirely | ⏳ Add sending email account in Instantly UI: Settings → Email Accounts → Connect | Kai |
| Apollo.io free plan blocks lead search | Lead Gen is mock-only | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-08 — switched to Hunter.io domain-search + AI Research Agent; Apollo no longer used | Haris |
| Lead Gen writes incomplete prospect records (missing name/company/title) | Rows in Airtable with only email + team_size:0 | Split Into Items node used Apollo field structure (p.first_name, p.organization.name) but Normalize Leads outputs flat format (prospect_name, company_name) | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-08 — Split Into Items rewritten to pass through pre-normalized fields directly | Haris |
| Lead Gen source field shows "apollo" after Hunter switch | source: apollo written by Write New Prospect despite Hunter data | Hardcoded string in jsonBody | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-08 — changed to source: hunter | Haris |
| Hunter returns contacts with no name AND no job title | bro.man@domain.com style addresses slip through — unusable for personalized outreach | Normalize Leads kept no-title contacts by default | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-08 — skip leads where both prospect_name and job_title are empty | Haris |
| Lovable website repo (kaicodesai/phoenixautomation) is private — no direct Claude/agent access | Medium — website changes require manual edits or GitHub token | ⏳ Options: (1) Add GitHub PAT scoped to phoenixautomation repo to session credentials, (2) Enable Lovable → GitHub sync and share PAT, (3) Make repo public temporarily for changes | Kai |

| Lead Gen reverting to Apollo — enrichment Code node broken | Enrich Prospects Code node failed with `fetch is not defined` and `$http is not defined` | n8n Code node sandbox has no HTTP capability — must use HTTP Request node | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-20 — Kai rebuilt workflow with HTTP Request node for Apollo `/people/match` enrichment; 10 prospects enriched + written PASS | Kai |
| Haris n8n Cloud access not confirmed | Blocked Haris from verifying workflow state | Pending invite from Kai | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-20 — Haris confirmed access to kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud | — |
| pa-imap credential missing | [PA] Outreach Agent Branch 5 (reply detection) cannot activate — IMAP_CREDENTIAL_ID placeholder used | IMAP credential not yet created in n8n | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-22 — pa-imap created (ID: 8MxHTFkPLgLLUO1U); [PA] Outreach Agent activated | Kai |
| Scoping Notifier SMTP credential invalid | Send Scoping Ready Email showed "No credentials yet" | Credential ID bDfSSn7mCBqpvb2Y does not exist in n8n — correct ID is BMlj5xK8OMFXYMzw (SMTP account 2) | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-23 — credential updated in Scoping Notifier and Scope Approval | Haris |
| Scoping Notifier Mark Notified node broken | scoping_notified_at never written; wrong record always PATCHed | specifyBody missing (showed "Using Fields Below" with empty params); URL used $json.record_id which is undefined after emailSend (SMTP output replaces $json) | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-23 — specifyBody:json added; URL fixed to $('Loop Over Prospects').item.json.record_id | Haris |
| Scoping Agent + Error Handler emails rendered raw expressions | Email body showed ={{ $("Node").item.json.field }} as literal text | HTML expressions used ={{ }} format: = prefix is literal text in Fixed mode, and HTML field in expression mode ignores inline {{ }} | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-23 — stripped = prefix from HTML field value and all ={{ → {{ throughout both email bodies | Haris |
| Scope Approval Approve button returned raw JSON | Browser showed {"code":0,"message":"Unused Respond to Webhook node found"} | Webhook trigger responseMode was lastNode — n8n responded with last node's SMTP output, Respond to Webhook node was ignored | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-23 — responseMode changed to responseNode; Respond to Browser body added (branded success HTML) | Haris |
| Outreach Agent Merge Email Paths blocked when one Switch branch empty | Workflow hung when all prospects had emails pre-saved or all needed AI generation | n8n Merge node waits for all inputs; if Switch routes everything to one output the other Merge input never fires | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-23 — Merge node removed; both Switch outputs now connect directly to Build HTML Emails (Code node runs independently per path) | Haris |
| Onboarding Automation Airtable write nodes failing | Workflow executed but errored silently on Airtable POST/PATCH nodes | Create Airtable Client Record had an empty body and stale downstream references | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-24 — Create Client body rebuilt, downstream references fixed, summary/welcome email routing corrected | Haris |

| Owner notification emails went to legacy Gmail | Medium | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-24 — all Kai notifications now route to kai@phoenixautomation.ai; stale body/reply-to strings removed from live n8n workflows | Haris |
| Lead Generation volume low after Apollo restore | Medium | ✅ MITIGATED 2026-04-24 — root cause was duplicate-heavy repeated Apollo slice; search is now US-only with per_page=100, enrich top 25, broader targeting, rotating ICP slices. Monitor next 2 daily runs. | Haris |
| Proposal draft only stored in Airtable | Low | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-24 — Airtable remains source of truth for proposal_draft; Scope Approval now also creates a ClickUp Lead Management review task for Kai | Haris |
| Typeform Lead Qualification blocked by n8n free OpenAI credits | High | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-24 — replaced free-credit/OpenAI LangChain path with Anthropic HTTP using the existing Anthropic credential; safe smoke PASS execution 1595 | Haris |
| Scoping Agent failed on OpenRouter/rate-limit and Airtable field coercion | High | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-24 — replaced OpenRouter path with Anthropic HTTP, hardened webhook response, JSON body construction, tools_required text normalization, and Prospects-safe service_tier mapping; safe smoke PASS execution 1596 | Haris |
| Onboarding Automation failed after approved scope | High | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-24 — fixed stale scope lookup, preserved Airtable context, corrected n8n API credential, patched ClickUp credential to account 2, and hardened ClickUp error merge path; safe smoke PASS execution 1599 | Haris |
| Outreach backlog after repairs | Medium | Watch — preflight found 3 pending Email 1 records and 33 Email 2 eligible records. Do not manually run against production unless ready for sends; monitor next scheduled run and Airtable send timestamps. | Kai/Haris |
| ClickUp internal checklist has fewer tasks than blueprint | Low | Live audit 2026-04-24 shows Lead Management has 3 tasks and Operations has 3 tasks; acceptable for launch, but blueprint lists 5/6 tasks if Kai wants fuller operating checklists | Kai/Haris |
| Website chatbot not built | High — blueprint requires 24/7 AI qualifier before Typeform | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-03 — [PA] Website Chatbot built (EPMCxdqKOuwc6hzB, 15 nodes); embed widget at docs/website-chatbot-embed.html — Kai pastes snippet into website and activates workflow | Haris |
| Website chatbot bot messages showing as empty grey circles | High — users saw no responses after each question | All n8n Set nodes (Greeting, Q2, Q3, Hot/Borderline/Cold Response Data) were completely empty — no fields configured. "Send Early Step Response" referenced `$json.message` which was undefined, returning `[{}]` | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-10 — all nodes configured with proper fields; Response Body set to `{{ JSON.stringify($json) }}` | Kai |
| Website chatbot step 3 returning "Something went wrong" | High — leads couldn't complete qualification | "Score Lead via Claude" was a Langchain AI node requiring "Anthropic API" credential type; pa-anthropic is HTTP Header Auth — incompatible | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-10 — replaced with HTTP Request node calling Anthropic API directly; Parse Claude Score updated to read HTTP response format | Kai |
| Chatbot hot leads not written to Airtable | High — leads booked calls but no Airtable record created | Write Hot Prospect to Airtable node had field names mismatched after Langchain replacement; Airtable Prospects table missing pain/score/source fields | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-10 — 3 new fields added (biggest_operational_pain, lead_score_grade, lead_source); n8n node field names aligned; E2E verified (record recRypnI7vsMlisJR) | Kai |
| Credential auto-handoff gap — no detector when credentials arrive | High — Kai must manually set project_status=build.ready | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-03 — [PA] Credential Detector built (hbtSbm2pzrHX1QTn, 10 nodes); polls every 2h, auto-sets build.ready + emails Kai — Kai activates | Haris |
| No mock client for end-to-end testing new use cases | Medium — no reference example for workflow-builder-agent | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-03 — docs/clients/sarahs-wellness-studio/ created (process-map.md + scope-of-work.md); Typeform program admission use case fully scoped | Haris |
| Welcome email says "I'll send exact instructions shortly" — credential follow-up is NOT automated | High | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-03-26 — tool-specific step-by-step instructions now inline in welcome email; subject updated | Haris |
| Status Update Agent could mix tasks from clients with wrong/null clickup_folder_id | High | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-03-26 — Split Client Records filters out clients with no folder ID; Get All Tasks endpoint changed to folder-specific URL | Haris |
| Client n8n account model not decided | High — blocks Workflow Builder Agent | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-03-26 — Client creates and owns their own n8n account. Client shares n8n API key + instance URL as part of credential collection (alongside other tools). Welcome email needs n8n setup instructions added. Workflow Builder prereq: n8n API key in Airtable before build starts. | Kai |

- [x] ✅ Build [PA] Referral Trigger Agent (2026-03-24)
- [x] ✅ Onboarding Automation, Status Update Agent, Lead Generation active on schedule (confirmed 2026-03-31)
- [ ] Activate remaining 3 inactive workflows: ClickUp Sync, Referral Trigger, Reporting Agent (Kai)
- [ ] First real client onboarded end-to-end

## Long-term
- [ ] Apollo.io paid plan for higher volume
- [ ] Generalize Agent Foundry for second business type

> **Client n8n model — DECIDED (2026-03-26):** Each client creates and owns their own n8n account. During credential collection (onboarding), the client shares their n8n API key and instance URL alongside their other tool credentials. The **Workflow Builder Agent** (automated — runs via n8n-MCP) then uses that API key to connect to the client's n8n instance and build their custom automations there automatically. This is Step 7 of the delivery pipeline. The `n8n_workspace_id` field in Airtable stores the client's n8n instance URL. The welcome email must include n8n account setup as a required credential step. "Client n8n API key in Airtable" is a hard prerequisite before the Workflow Builder Agent can run.

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-24 (Workflow/API Audit + Safe Smoke Test)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude

### What was completed
- Audited all live [PA] workflows through the n8n API and ClickUp through the ClickUp API.
- Fixed Outreach Agent duplicate Email 1 risk with a pre-send Airtable lock; unblocked Email 2/3 by removing invalid Airtable fields[] restrictions and stabilizing follow-up item references.
- Fixed Onboarding Automation client creation body and stale summary/Prospect conversion references.
- Routed all Kai notifications and stale email body/reply-to strings to kai@phoenixautomation.ai.
- Fixed Credential Detector/Follow-Up, ClickUp Sync, Website Chatbot, Scope Approval, and related Airtable JSON/logging issues from the audit.
- Refined Lead Generation to US-only Apollo search with larger candidate volume and rotating ICP slices.
- Verified ClickUp structure: Phoenix Automation space has Client Projects, Internal (Lead Management, Operations, Outreach), and test client folders at space root; no folderless lists remain.
- Ran full safe smoke suite without manually triggering production outreach/status/referral sends. PASS results:
  - Lead Generation latest scheduled/manual execution 1459
  - Outreach Agent latest scheduled/manual execution 1590
  - Status Update Agent latest scheduled/manual execution 716
  - Referral Trigger Agent latest scheduled/manual execution 1477
  - ClickUp Sync latest scheduled/manual execution 1531
  - Credential Follow-Up latest scheduled/manual execution 1367
  - Credential Detector latest scheduled/manual execution 1533
  - Scoping Notifier latest scheduled/manual execution 1591
  - Website Chatbot early-step webhook flow returned valid JSON and next_step progression
  - Typeform Lead Qualification webhook PASS execution 1595
  - Scoping Agent webhook PASS execution 1596
  - Scope Approval webhook PASS execution 1598
  - Onboarding Automation webhook PASS execution 1599; created Client `recBZSa9WsYabJawm` and ClickUp folder `90148889216`
- Additional live fixes from smoke testing:
  - Created/corrected the n8n API credential used by Onboarding (`pa-n8n-api`).
  - Replaced Typeform's exhausted free OpenAI/LangChain path with Anthropic HTTP.
  - Replaced OpenRouter/LangChain nodes in Scoping, Scope Approval, and Outreach with Anthropic HTTP where needed.
  - Fixed Scoping webhook response mode, Airtable JSON bodies, `tools_required` text coercion, and valid service_tier mappings.
  - Patched Onboarding scope lookup, Airtable context handoff, ClickUp credential usage, and ClickUp error-path merge logic.
- Marked synthetic QA Airtable records as non-actionable after testing (`project_status=test-complete` or `lost`, `outreach_status=test-complete`).

### What is in progress (not finished)
- Monitor Lead Generation for the next 2 daily runs to confirm the US-only wider Apollo search produces more than the previous 2-lead day.
- Monitor Outreach after the next scheduled 07:00 run: preflight found 3 pending Email 1 records and 33 Email 2 eligible records, so the next real scheduled run may send queued outreach/follow-ups.
- ClickUp Internal checklists are usable but lighter than the original blueprint: Lead Management has 3 tasks and Operations has 3 tasks.

### Blockers for next session
- Reporting Agent and Workflow Builder Agent remain inactive by design until there is a live retainer/build-ready client.
- Stripe webhook integration is still not started.

### Next person should start with
1. Check n8n executions after the next 06:45 Lead Generation and 07:00 Outreach runs.
2. Confirm Email 1 count in Airtable Prospects and verify eligible records advance to Email 2/3 on schedule.
3. Decide whether to expand ClickUp Lead Management/Operations from 3 tasks each to the full blueprint checklist.

### Files changed this session
- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
- docs/setup/clickup-structure.md
- Live n8n workflows patched via API: Onboarding Automation, Typeform Lead Qualification, Scoping Agent, Scope Approval, Outreach Agent, Status Update Agent, ClickUp Sync

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-25 (Session 8 — continued)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **End-to-end systems test** — Steps 1–4 executed and verified:
  - Step 1: Prospect record `recd7jqEXed0v3oBe` created (Prospects table, `outreach_status=pending`)
  - Step 2: Client record `recNr32G2QJd5bbkw` created (Brightline Property Management / Sarah Chen)
  - Step 3: Onboarding Automation webhook triggered → execution 70 → **PASS** (all 6 Airtable fields written, ClickUp folder `90148085794` created)
  - Step 4: ClickUp folder ID confirmed in Airtable; list count unverifiable (ClickUp key expired mid-session)
- **Bug fix:** Corrected `service_tier` options in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md — `growth-package` → `growth-build` (plus added full option list)
- **QA report written:** `docs/clients/brightline-property-management/e2e-test-report.md`
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated:** version bump, Known Issues, TODO, session handoff

### What is in progress (not finished)
- Steps 5 and 6 of E2E test (Status Update Agent + Referral Trigger Agent) — test data is ready, waiting on manual execution from n8n editor

### Blockers for next session
- Haris not yet invited to n8n Cloud (Kai action required)
- Status Update Agent and Referral Trigger Agent cannot be triggered via API — must be run from n8n editor
- Instantly.ai not configured — Referral Trigger Agent will log stub, not send emails

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai:** Open n8n editor → run [PA] Status Update Agent manually → verify email sent to `muneebfiaz201@gmail.com`
3. **Kai:** Open n8n editor → run [PA] Referral Trigger Agent manually → verify `referral_sequence_sent=true` in Airtable + entry in `automation_logs`
4. **Kai/Haris:** Clean up Brightline test records (instructions in `docs/clients/brightline-property-management/e2e-test-report.md`)
5. **Haris (after n8n access):** Fix `onboarding_started_at` — add field to Node 21 of Onboarding Automation

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.4, service_tier options corrected, Known Issues + TODO updated, Session 8 handoff
- `docs/clients/brightline-property-management/e2e-test-report.md` — created (new)

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-10 (Session 11)
**Worked by:** Kai + Claude (Claude Code web)

### What was completed
- **Website conversion optimisation** — 9 changes applied via Lovable prompt (higher price language replacing $1,500 mention, urgency mechanism, retainer-implied ongoing support, single highest-converting CTA)
- **Chatbot widget embedded on phoenixautomation.ai** — complete widget in index.html before `</body>` tag; orange bubble (#E8520A), 7s teaser + 13s auto-open popup, local greeting, close button
- **Chatbot empty messages fixed** — all n8n Set nodes (Greeting, Q2 Response, Q3 Response, Hot/Borderline/Cold Response Data) configured with proper fields; Response Body set to `{{ JSON.stringify($json) }}`
- **Chatbot step 3 error fixed** — "Score Lead via Claude" Langchain AI node replaced with HTTP Request node (Langchain requires "Anthropic API" credential type; pa-anthropic is HTTP Header Auth — incompatible). Parse Claude Score node updated to read `$input.first().json.content?.[0]?.text` with markdown fence stripping
- **Airtable Prospects table updated** — 3 new fields added: `biggest_operational_pain`, `lead_score_grade`, `lead_source`; chatbot n8n node field names aligned to match
- **End-to-end chatbot pipeline verified** — hot lead flow created record `recRypnI7vsMlisJR` in Airtable Prospects. Full flow: phoenixautomation.ai widget → 3 questions → Claude scoring → Airtable write → Calendly booking link returned
- **Branch merged to main** — all chatbot + website changes merged from `claude/project-status-client-readiness-c2Vy2` to `main` (commit `5268dd8`)
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated** — v4.7, chatbot fully documented, 3 new Known Issues resolved, Recurring Bugs updated, Prospects schema updated

### What is in progress (not finished)
- Nothing — all tasks from this session are complete

### Blockers for next session
- Instantly.ai: warmup_status=0, needs enabling manually in Instantly dashboard (Settings → Email Accounts → toggle warmup ON)
- Instantly 19 duplicate leads need manual cleanup before Outreach Agent E2E can be re-tested
- Lovable/phoenixautomation repo is private — future website changes require Kai to add GitHub PAT or use Lovable UI directly
- Remote Claude Code sessions cannot call n8n API directly (egress proxy blocks kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud) — all future n8n changes must use local Python scripts

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **KAI:** Enable Instantly email warmup in Instantly dashboard (Settings → Email Accounts → warmup toggle)
3. **KAI:** Delete 19 duplicate leads in Instantly dashboard, then re-run [PA] Outreach Agent to test HTML email personalisation
4. **KAI:** Activate [PA] Outreach Agent (ID: Mib6RUtJ2IOaUZ4s) after Instantly cleanup + warmup enabled
5. **KAI:** Activate pending workflows: Error Handler, Typeform Lead Qualification, Credential Follow-Up, Referral Trigger Agent, ClickUp Sync

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v4.7, chatbot fully operational, Prospects schema updated, Recurring Bugs + Known Issues updated
- **n8n workflows updated (via local Python scripts — no repo file changes):**
  - `[PA] Website Chatbot` (EPMCxdqKOuwc6hzB) — all Set nodes configured, Langchain→HTTP Request replacement, Parse Claude Score rewritten, Airtable node field names aligned
- **phoenixautomation.ai (kaicodesai/phoenixautomation — private repo):**
  - `index.html` — 9 conversion optimisations + full chatbot widget embedded (edited manually by Kai in Lovable)

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-23 (Session 16)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **[PA] Scoping Notifier** (nXXsF4E1BPWIS62r) — 13 nodes, active; notifies Kai at kai@phoenixautomation.ai when a prospect is ready for scoping and exposes GET /trigger-scoping for browser-triggered handoff to Scoping Agent.
  - SMTP credential corrected: `bDfSSn7mCBqpvb2Y` (non-existent) → `BMlj5xK8OMFXYMzw` ("SMTP account 2")
  - `Mark Notified` node: added `specifyBody:json`; fixed `jsonBody` to write `scoping_notified_at`; fixed URL from `$json.record_id` (undefined after emailSend) to `$('Loop Over Prospects').item.json.record_id`
  - Cleared `scoping_notified_at` for Muneeb (test-co) so it re-triggered; added `client_slug=test-co`
- **[PA] Scoping Agent** — email expressions fixed: HTML field was in expression mode (`=` prefix) with `={{ }}` inline; stripped `=` prefix and replaced all `={{ ` → `{{ ` throughout HTML body
- **[PA] Error Handler** — same expression fix applied: `={{ }}` → `{{ }}` in Alert Kai email body
- **[PA] Scope Approval** (UB6ZdrnYpJlYfxD4) — 9 nodes, active; reads/writes Prospects table, locks approved scope, saves proposal_draft to Airtable as source of truth, creates a ClickUp Lead Management review task, and emails Kai at kai@phoenixautomation.ai.
  - Webhook trigger `responseMode`: `lastNode` → `responseNode` (was sending SMTP JSON to browser)
  - `Respond to Browser`: added branded success HTML ("✅ Scope Approved — proposal arriving in inbox")
  - Email credential + expression format fixed (same `bDfSSn7mCBqpvb2Y` → `BMlj5xK8OMFXYMzw`; `={{ }}` → `{{ }}`)
  - `Save Proposal to Airtable` / `Email Proposal to Kai`: fixed field reference from `$json.content[0].text` → `$('Claude — Proposal').item.json.output` (chainLlm format); added `specifyBody:json`
- **[PA] Outreach Agent** (Mib6RUtJ2IOaUZ4s) — 52 nodes — rebuilt 2026-04-21, activated 2026-04-22, patched 2026-04-24: Email 1 now has a pre-send Airtable lock to prevent duplicate sends, Email 2/3 lookup field errors were fixed, follow-up branches reference stable loop items, reply notification routes to kai@phoenixautomation.ai, and all loops use batch size 1.
- **pa-smtp canonical credential documented**: `BMlj5xK8OMFXYMzw` ("SMTP account 2") is the correct ID for all emailSend nodes; `bDfSSn7mCBqpvb2Y` does not exist
- **Recurring Bugs updated** — 3 new entries: `={{ }}` expression bug, Merge blocking bug, emailSend overwriting `$json`

### What is in progress (not finished)
- **Onboarding Automation Airtable write errors** — nodes that write to Airtable (Create Client Record / Update Airtable Record) are failing but `continueOnFail` means the workflow executes anyway without writing data. Root cause under investigation — likely field name mismatch or missing typecast.

### Blockers for next session
- Onboarding Automation fix needed before first real client can be onboarded end-to-end
- Default GitHub branch still needs switching (`claude/setup-blueprint-agent-YnHBF` → `main`)
- Airtable PAT rotation still pending

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Fix Onboarding Automation**: open n8n → run [PA] Onboarding Automation with test payload → check which Airtable nodes fail → look at error details → fix field names or body format
3. **Test full scope pipeline**: set a Prospect to `project_status=call_complete` + `call_notes` filled → wait for Scoping Notifier email → click "Start Scoping Now" → verify Scoping Agent writes scope to Prospects → click Approve Scope link → verify success page + proposal email arrives

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v5.4, all session fixes documented, Known Issues + Recurring Bugs updated
- **n8n workflows updated (via Node.js scripts):**
  - `[PA] Scoping Notifier` (nXXsF4E1BPWIS62r) — SMTP credential, Mark Notified body+URL
  - `[PA] Scoping Agent` (E24KwVMam1e8bbjT) — email HTML expression format
  - `[PA] Error Handler` (JByknkdAgxRmDKp3) — email HTML expression format
  - `[PA] Scope Approval` (UB6ZdrnYpJlYfxD4) — webhook responseMode, Respond to Browser HTML, email credential + expressions, Save Proposal field ref
  - `[PA] Outreach Agent` (Mib6RUtJ2IOaUZ4s) — Merge Email Paths node removed

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-22 (Session 15)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **[PA] Scoping Notifier built and activated** (nXXsF4E1BPWIS62r, 14 nodes) — when Kai marks a Prospect `project_status=call_complete`, within 5 min she receives a branded email with full prospect details + "Start Scoping Now" button; clicking the button fires the Scoping Agent automatically via GET webhook (no form, no copy-paste). `scoping_notified_at` field added to Prospects table (ID: flde95Hj9sw6YsCBo) to prevent duplicate notifications.
- **[PA] Outreach Agent activated** — pa-imap credential created by Kai (ID: 8MxHTFkPLgLLUO1U); Outreach Agent now fully live including IMAP reply detection (Branch 5).
- **Prospects table updated** — `scoping_notified_at` field added (dateTime).
- **`client_slug` auto-derivation added to all 3 prospect creation paths** — Lead Gen (Write New Prospect1), Website Chatbot (Write Hot Prospect to Airtable), Typeform Lead Qualification (Write to Airtable) all now compute client_slug from company_name on write.

### What is in progress (not finished)
- No E2E test of the new Onboarding flow yet — needs a real Prospect record with scope data + payment webhook

### Blockers for next session
- Default GitHub branch still set to `claude/setup-blueprint-agent-YnHBF`
- Airtable PAT rotation still pending
- Onboarding E2E test pending (real Prospect + scope + payment webhook)

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **To test the full pipeline end-to-end:**
   a. Find a Prospect record in Airtable with email + call_notes filled in; set project_status=call_complete
   b. Within 5 min: check kai@phoenixautomation.ai for Scoping Notifier email
   c. Click "Start Scoping Now" → check Scoping Agent writes scope to Prospects + sets scope_review
   d. Click approve link → verify Scope Approval writes proposal_draft + scope_locked_at to Prospects
   e. POST to /payment-confirmed with that email → verify new Clients record created, ClickUp seeded, emails sent
3. **KAI:** Change default GitHub branch to main (GitHub Settings → Branches)

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v5.3, Outreach Agent activated, Scoping Notifier documented, Prospects schema updated
- **n8n workflows built/updated (via Node.js scripts — no repo file changes):**
  - `[PA] Scoping Notifier` (nXXsF4E1BPWIS62r) — created new, 14 nodes, active
- **Airtable changes:**
  - Prospects table: `scoping_notified_at` dateTime field created (ID: flde95Hj9sw6YsCBo)

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-22 (Session 14)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **Prospect→Client architecture redesigned (Option A)** — full pipeline restructured so all pre-payment data lives in the Prospects table and the Clients table is only populated on payment:
  - **Scoping Agent** updated: now reads `project_status=call_complete` from Prospects table (was Clients); writes all scope fields (scope_of_work, scope_summary, service_tier, automation_1/2/3, tools_required) back to Prospects; sets Prospects.project_status=scope_review
  - **Scope Approval** updated: now reads/writes Prospects table (was Clients); saves scope_locked_at + proposal_draft to Prospects; sets project_status=proposal_sent
  - **Onboarding Automation** rebuilt (nodes 5–8 redesigned):
    - Node 5: "Lookup Prospect" — HTTP GET Prospects table by email (was: Airtable lookup Clients)
    - Node 6: "Merge Airtable Context" — extracts ALL prospect + scope fields (lead_score_grade, pre_call_brief, industry, all scope/automation fields, call_notes, prospect_record_id)
    - Node 7: "Create Airtable Client Record" — HTTP POST creates NEW Clients record with all data copied from prospect (was: old "Lookup Prospect by Email" — redundant lookup node)
    - Node 8: "Extract Client Record ID" — extracts airtable_record_id from POST response (was: "Merge Prospect Context" — now redundant)
    - Node 10: "Extract Workspace ID" updated to reference "Extract Client Record ID"
    - "Mark Prospect Converted" URL fixed to explicit node reference `$('Merge Airtable Context').first().json.prospect_record_id`
- **16 scope fields added to Prospects table** (most were pre-existing; automation_count created via Metadata API — field ID: fldvkmErwVz4bAMDO): client_slug, call_notes, project_status, scope_of_work, scope_summary, service_tier, tools_required, automation_count, automation_1/2/3 name+description, proposal_draft, scope_locked_at
- **field name bug fixed** — Prospects field is `Precall Brief` (capital P, space); Onboarding was reading `prospect.pre_call_brief` (null). Fixed to `prospect['Precall Brief']`
- **field name bug fixed** — Create Client Record was sending `client_name` (wrong); fixed to `contact_name`. Was sending `package` (no such Clients field); fixed to `service_tier`
- **Onboarding Automation flow verified** — connection chain confirmed: Derive Client Slug → Lookup Prospect → Merge Airtable Context → Create Airtable Client Record → Extract Client Record ID → Create n8n Workspace
- **Execution #829 diagnosed** — test payload (Muneeb Fiaz / Test Co) from Postman; flow stopped at Airtable lookup because test client didn't exist — expected behaviour, not a bug

### What is in progress (not finished)
- [PA] Outreach Agent is INACTIVE — waiting on Kai to create pa-imap credential
- No E2E test of the new Onboarding flow yet — needs a real Prospect record with scope data populated

### Blockers for next session
- **Kai must create pa-imap credential** before Outreach Agent can activate
- To test Onboarding: need a Prospect record in Airtable with email + scope fields populated + a payment webhook sent with that email
- Default GitHub branch still set to `claude/setup-blueprint-agent-YnHBF`
- Airtable PAT rotation still pending

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **To test the full pipeline end-to-end:**
   a. Create/find a Prospect record in Airtable with email + call_notes filled in
   b. Set Prospects.project_status = call_complete
   c. Trigger Scoping Agent via /scope-call webhook with that client_slug → verify scope fields written to Prospects
   d. Click the approve link in email → verify Scope Approval writes proposal_draft + scope_locked_at to Prospects
   e. POST to /payment-confirmed with that email → verify new Clients record created with all data, ClickUp project seeded, emails sent
3. **KAI:** Create pa-imap credential → activate [PA] Outreach Agent
4. **KAI:** Change default GitHub branch to main (GitHub Settings → Branches)

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v5.2, Option A architecture documented, Prospects schema fully expanded, Onboarding node summary rewritten
- **n8n workflows updated (via Node.js scripts — no repo file changes):**
  - `[PA] Onboarding Automation` (7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM) — nodes 5–8 redesigned for prospect→client copy
  - `[PA] Scoping Agent` (E24KwVMam1e8bbjT) — 4 nodes switched from Clients to Prospects table
  - `[PA] Scope Approval` (UB6ZdrnYpJlYfxD4) — 3 nodes switched from Clients to Prospects table
- **Airtable changes:**
  - Prospects table: `automation_count` field created (field ID: fldvkmErwVz4bAMDO); all other scope fields were pre-existing

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-21 (Session 13)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **[PA] Outreach Agent fully rebuilt** — 51 nodes (was 12); direct SMTP replaces Instantly.ai entirely; 5 parallel branches fire from single schedule + manual trigger:
  - Branch 1: pending prospects → Email 1 sent immediately → ClickUp task created → status=email_1_sent
  - Branch 2: email_1_sent + >1 day old → Email 2 → status=email_2_sent
  - Branch 3: email_2_sent + >2 days old → Email 3 → status=email_3_sent
  - Branch 4: email_3_sent + >7 days old → status=completed
  - Branch 5: IMAP inbox poll → filter real replies (bounce/auto-reply exclusion) → lookup prospect → status=replied → ClickUp=Replied → Kai notification email; reply blocks all further follow-ups
- **ClickUp Outreach list created** — ID: 901415694346; statuses: Email 1 Sent / Email 2 Sent / Email 3 Sent / Replied / Error / Completed
- **4 new Airtable Prospects fields added** — email_1_sent_at, email_2_sent_at, email_3_sent_at, clickup_outreach_task_id
- **Scoping Agent slug dropdown updated** — client_slug field changed from free-text to dropdown; Onboarding Automation extended to 55 nodes with auto-refresh of dropdown on every new onboard
- **Typeform Lead Qualification updated** — full_name field added at position 0; prospect_name in Airtable now uses full_name instead of "BusinessName (owner)"
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated to v5.0**

### What is in progress (not finished)
- [PA] Outreach Agent is INACTIVE — waiting on Kai to create pa-imap credential

### Blockers for next session
- **Kai must create pa-imap credential** in n8n before Outreach Agent can be activated (type: IMAP, host: imap.gmail.com:993 SSL, kai@phoenixautomation.ai, same app password as pa-smtp, name: pa-imap)
- Default GitHub branch still set to `claude/setup-blueprint-agent-YnHBF` — Kai changes in GitHub Settings
- Airtable PAT rotation still pending

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **KAI:** In n8n → Credentials → New → IMAP → host: imap.gmail.com, port: 993, SSL, user: kai@phoenixautomation.ai, password: Google Workspace App Password → name it `pa-imap` → save; then activate [PA] Outreach Agent
3. **Haris:** E2E test Outreach Agent — set one Airtable prospect to outreach_status=pending → run manually → verify Email 1 sent, ClickUp task created, status updated to email_1_sent
4. **Haris:** Test Scoping Agent — submit /scope-call with Sarah's Wellness Studio slug (should appear in dropdown after Onboarding Automation ran)
5. **KAI:** Activate remaining workflows: Error Handler, Typeform Lead Qualification, Credential Follow-Up, Referral Trigger Agent, ClickUp Sync

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v5.0, Outreach Agent rebuilt (51 nodes), ClickUp Outreach list added, 4 Prospects fields added, Scoping Agent dropdown documented, Typeform full_name field documented
- **n8n workflows updated (via Node.js scripts — no repo file changes):**
  - `[PA] Outreach Agent` (Mib6RUtJ2IOaUZ4s) — fully rebuilt, 51 nodes, SMTP multi-step sequence
  - `[PA] Scoping Agent` (E24KwVMam1e8bbjT) — client_slug changed to dropdown
  - `[PA] Onboarding Automation` (7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM) — extended to 55 nodes with slug dropdown auto-refresh
  - `[PA] Typeform Lead Qualification` (kXxN7O77ongTMwKG) — full_name field + Extract Answers + Write to Airtable updated
- **Airtable changes:**
  - Prospects table: 4 new fields added (email_1_sent_at, email_2_sent_at, email_3_sent_at, clickup_outreach_task_id)
- **ClickUp changes:**
  - New Outreach list (ID: 901415694346) created under Internal folder

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-20 (Session 12)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **Lead Gen live test PASS** — execution 711 (2026-04-20 10:45): 10 prospects fully enriched via Apollo `/people/match` and written to Airtable with real names, companies, job titles, emails, LinkedIn URLs, `source: apollo`
- **Lead Gen workflow documented** — reverted from Hunter/Tavily back to Apollo 13-node architecture; node count corrected (13, not 18)
- **Morning Brief Delivery added to registry** — workflow EKKXeBCEiKXaYBCx confirmed ACTIVE; previously undocumented
- **Workflow activation states corrected** — all 14 PA workflows audited via n8n API; 12 now confirmed ACTIVE, 2 remain inactive (Reporting Agent, Workflow Builder Agent, Scope Approval)
- **Haris n8n access confirmed** — kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud; Haris machine table updated
- **Instantly duplicates resolved** — 19 old duplicate leads cleared (Kai); Outreach E2E test re-test ready
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated to v4.8**

### What is in progress (not finished)
- Outreach Agent HTML email E2E — duplicates cleared, needs a manual test run to verify personalised HTML sends correctly
- Morning Brief Delivery node count unknown — fetch from n8n to document

### Blockers for next session
- Default GitHub branch still set to `claude/setup-blueprint-agent-YnHBF` — Kai changes in GitHub Settings
- Airtable PAT rotation pending (pat from deleted test_outreach.js was in git history)

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Haris:** Run [PA] Outreach Agent manually from n8n editor → check Instantly for personalised HTML email delivery → verify `outreach_status=in_sequence` in Airtable Prospects
3. **Haris:** Fetch Morning Brief Delivery (EKKXeBCEiKXaYBCx) node list + document node summary in this file
4. **KAI:** Rotate Airtable PAT in account settings → update `pa-airtable` credential in n8n

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v4.8, Lead Gen corrected (Apollo 13-node), Morning Brief added, all workflow activation states updated, Haris n8n access confirmed, Known Issues updated

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-27 (Session 10)
**Worked by:** Kai

### What was completed
- **[PA] Referral Trigger Agent E2E test — PASS** (all 6 steps complete)
  - Brightline record picked up by filter, Claude emails generated, Airtable flags written correctly
- **Referral Trigger Agent bugs fixed (5 bugs this session):**
  1. `{referral_sequence_sent}=FALSE()` → `NOT({referral_sequence_sent})` (invalid Airtable formula)
  2. `fields[]` query params removed from Fetch node — n8n doesn't reliably send repeated same-key params
  3. `record_id` lost after HTTP nodes — fixed with `$('Extract Referral Emails').item.json.record_id`
  4. `Split Client Records` had `|| ,` (missing fallback string) — fixed to `|| ''`
  5. `referral_sequence_sent_at` sent as ISO timestamp to date field — fixed with `.split('T')[0]`
- **Status Update Agent bugs fixed (3 bugs this session):**
  1. `Split Client Records` missing node name: `$().first()` → `$('Fetch Active Clients').first()`
  2. `Get All Tasks From Folder` URL: `/folder/{id}/task` (doesn't exist) → `/team/90141018999/task?folder_ids[]={id}`
  3. `Error Skip` rewritten to pass through client data + `tasks: []` so workflow continues on ClickUp error
- **pa-smtp** updated to kai@phoenixautomation.ai (Google Workspace, App Password)
- **Business updates:** Florida registration confirmed, EIN pending, Partnership Agreement sent to Howard
- **Client n8n model confirmed:** Option A — clients own their own n8n accounts
- Airtable test records cleaned up (Brightline + Prospects both set to test-complete)

### What is in progress (not finished)
- Reporting Agent: Fetch Executions node still has pa-anthropic credential (needs manual switch in editor)
- EIN application pending (document numbers required)
- Partnership Agreement awaiting Howard's signature

### Blockers for next session
- Outreach Agent blocked on Instantly.ai — needs PA domain first
- Onboarding flow needs updating for Option A client n8n model before first real client

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai:** Open Reporting Agent → Fetch Executions node → switch credential to pa-n8n-api → re-run test
3. **Kai:** Secure Phoenix Automation domain → set up Instantly.ai → then Haris builds Outreach Agent
4. **Before first real client:** Update Onboarding Automation for Option A (client self-serves n8n account)

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.7, E2E PASS, pa-smtp updated, 4 new recurring bugs, Session 10 handoff

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-26 (Session 9)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **FIX 1 — Meridian Consulting:** Status Test Client set to `test-complete`. Meridian ClickUp folder created (ID: `90148117751`) with 4 lists (Onboarding, Build, QA, Live). Airtable record updated with correct folder ID.
- **FIX 2 — Status Update Agent (94DpGwRPWGRPqCVU):** `Split Client Records` node now filters out clients with null/empty `clickup_folder_id`. `Get All Tasks From Folder` URL changed from team-level (`/team/{id}/task?folder_id[]=`) to folder-specific (`/folder/{id}/task`) — eliminates cross-team task bleed.
- **FIX 3 — Onboarding welcome email (7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM):** "I'll send exact instructions shortly" placeholder replaced with per-tool step-by-step instructions for: Airtable, Gmail, Calendly, QuickBooks, Buildium, Zapier, Typeform. Subject updated to "Action required: Set up your automation credentials". 5-business-day deadline added.
- **FIX 4 — `onboarding_started_at` (7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM):** Added to Node 21 (Update Airtable Record) jsonBody — now written as `new Date().toISOString()` on every onboarding run.
- **Root cause confirmed for email pollution:** Not Meridian (`project_status=lead`) — was `Status Test Client` with `project_status=live` and `clickup_folder_id=90147969224` (Client Projects parent folder, not a client folder). Fixed.
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated:** Known Issues resolved, TODO restructured, Session 9 handoff added.

### What is in progress (not finished)
- Step 6 of E2E test (Referral Trigger Agent) — Brightline test data still live and ready

### Blockers for next session
- Kai must run Referral Trigger Agent manually from n8n editor to complete Step 6
- Client n8n account model decision (Kai) — blocks Workflow Builder Agent scoping
- Haris not yet invited to n8n Cloud

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai:** Run [PA] Referral Trigger Agent from n8n editor — verify `referral_sequence_sent=true` on Brightline record (`recNr32G2QJd5bbkw`) + entry in `automation_logs`
3. **Kai:** Re-run [PA] Status Update Agent — verify clean email (only Brightline tasks, no PA internal tasks)
4. **Kai/Haris:** Clean up Brightline test records after Step 6 confirmed
5. **Kai:** Decide client n8n account model (Option A vs B) — reply to Haris so Workflow Builder Agent scope can be written

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.6, 4 Known Issues resolved, TODO restructured, Session 9 handoff
- `docs/clients/brightline-property-management/e2e-test-report.md` — updated Step 5 result + root cause, Step 6 instructions, bugs table expanded
- **n8n workflows updated (via API — no local file changes):**
  - `[PA] Status Update Agent` (94DpGwRPWGRPqCVU) — folder filter + endpoint fix
  - `[PA] Onboarding Automation` (7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM) — welcome email + onboarding_started_at

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-25 (Session 8 — Q&A + findings)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- [PA] Status Update Agent manually triggered by Haris from n8n editor — email received ✅
- Root cause identified for polluted Status Update email: Meridian Consulting still has `project_status=live` in Airtable — its ClickUp folder points to PA internal tasks, causing them to appear in client emails
- Three architectural gaps identified and documented:
  1. **Meridian Consulting pollution** — must set to `test-complete` immediately
  2. **Credential follow-up not automated** — "I'll send exact instructions shortly" in welcome email is placeholder text only; no follow-up workflow exists
  3. **Client n8n account model undecided** — Onboarding creates a stub label but doesn't provision a real n8n workspace for the client; decision needed before Workflow Builder Agent can be properly scoped
- Known Issues, TODO, and client n8n model note all updated in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

### What is in progress (not finished)
- [PA] Referral Trigger Agent manual test not yet done (Haris ran Status Update only this session)
- Brightline test records still live in Airtable — cleanup pending

### Blockers for next session
- Meridian Consulting `project_status` must be set to `test-complete` (Kai) before running any more Status Update tests
- Client n8n account model decision (Kai) blocks Workflow Builder Agent scoping and credential follow-up design
- Haris still not invited to n8n Cloud (Kai)

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai — do these first:**
   - Set Meridian Consulting `project_status = "test-complete"` in Airtable
   - Run [PA] Referral Trigger Agent from n8n editor → verify `referral_sequence_sent=true` on Brightline record + entry in `automation_logs`
   - Decide client n8n model: Option A (each client owns account) or Option B (all in Kai's account)
   - Update Calendly URL in workflow `ka6GesSfWVo2FZtU` node "Build Claude Payload"
3. **Haris (after Kai completes above):** Build automated credential follow-up email workflow, then [PA] Reporting Agent

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.5, 3 new Known Issues (Meridian pollution, credential gap, n8n model), TODO restructured with Kai urgency markers, client n8n note updated

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-24 (Session 7)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **[PA] Referral Trigger Agent** built via n8n API — ID: `ka6GesSfWVo2FZtU`, 13 nodes
  - Schedule trigger daily 08:00 + manual trigger
  - Fetches clients: `project_status=live`, `referral_sequence_sent_at=BLANK`, day 30 post-launch
  - Generates 2-touch referral email sequence via Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
  - Instantly.ai stubbed: logs `INSTANTLY_NOT_CONFIGURED` to `automation_logs` table
  - Sets `referral_sequence_sent_at` on completion (prevents re-firing)
  - False branch (no scope_of_work): also sets flag to prevent infinite daily re-check
- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated: workflow registry, TODO, Known Issues, session handoff

### What is in progress (not finished)
- [PA] Referral Trigger Agent not yet tested — Instantly.ai stub in place, Calendly URL needs updating before test

### Blockers for next session
- Haris not yet invited to n8n Cloud (Kai action required)
- Outreach Agent blocked on Instantly.ai account + pa-instantly credential

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai:** Invite Haris to n8n Cloud workspace
3. **Kai:** Update Calendly URL in [PA] Referral Trigger Agent — open workflow `ka6GesSfWVo2FZtU`, edit node "Build Claude Payload", replace `https://calendly.com/phoenixautomation/assessment` with real URL
4. **Kai:** Decide whether to add `automations_delivered` field to Airtable Clients table (currently uses `scope_of_work` as fallback)
5. **Kai:** Set up Instantly.ai account + domain — needed before Outreach Agent and Referral Trigger go live
6. **Haris (after n8n access):** QA all workflows visually in n8n Cloud editor, then build [PA] Reporting Agent

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.3, Referral Trigger added to registry, TODO/Known Issues updated, Session 7 handoff

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-08 (Session 18 — Outreach HTML + Hunter.io + AI Research Agent)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
1. **[PA] Outreach Agent — branded HTML email template** — dark blue #1B2A4A header/footer matching Status Update Agent; single-quoted HTML attributes to avoid JSON escaping issues; Build HTML Emails Code node added between Parse Email Sequence and Add Lead to Instantly
2. **Critical Code node return format fix** — Parse Email Sequence and Build HTML Emails both used `return [{json:{...}}]` in `runOnceForEachItem` mode; n8n requires `return {json:{...}}` (no array wrapper) — fixed both nodes
3. **[PA] Lead Generation — Hunter.io migration** — replaced Apollo HTTP Request with Hunter.io domain-search (`/v2/domain-search?domain=&api_key=&type=personal&limit=10`); modular 3-node architecture: Target Domains → Fetch Leads — Hunter.io → Normalize Leads
4. **AI Research Agent added to Lead Gen** — replaces static Target Domains Code node; `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent` (v1.7) uses GPT-4o-mini via n8n free OpenAI credits; system prompt describes full ICP; generates 8 real company domains per run, varied by date; Parse Research Output fallback to 3 known SMB domains
5. **Lead Gen field mapping fixed** — Split Into Items was using Apollo's nested format (`p.organization.name`, `p.title`); rewritten to pass through Normalize Leads' already-flat format (`prospect_name`, `company_name`, `job_title`)
6. **source field corrected** — Write New Prospect changed from `source: 'apollo'` to `source: 'hunter'`
7. **Empty-contact filter added** — Normalize Leads now skips contacts where both prospect_name AND job_title are empty (was keeping no-title contacts by default, allowing generic email addresses through)
8. **10 temp build scripts deleted** — fix_outreach.js, fix_parse_node.js, connect_apollo.js, upgrade_outreach_html.js, fix_instantly_body.js, add_html_node.js, fix_html_quotes.js, fix_return_format.js, switch_to_hunter.js, add_ai_research.js
9. **Tavily live web search added to Lead Gen** — Tavily Search Code node runs 3 parallel searches (DTC brands, marketing agencies, SaaS ops) via Tavily API (`tvly-dev-...`) before the AI Research Agent; live results injected into GPT prompt so agent works from real-time web data instead of training data; credential stored directly in Code node; Tavily free tier: 1000 searches/month

### What is in progress (not finished)
- **Outreach HTML email E2E not fully verified** — Instantly has 19 old duplicate leads in the campaign; new leads can't be added for those emails; personalization shows 0 chars. Exec 202 succeeded and Airtable shows `in_sequence` but Instantly side unverified
- **Lead Gen not yet re-run after all fixes** — AI Research Agent deployed but not manually tested end-to-end; some old bad rows (rows 7–14) still in Airtable from the broken run

### Blockers for next session
- **Instantly duplicate cleanup** — 19 old leads with same test emails block the outreach E2E test. Must delete them manually in Instantly dashboard (Leads tab → select all → delete), then re-trigger Outreach Agent with fresh pending prospects
- **Email warmup** — warmup_status: 0; enable in Instantly dashboard → Email Accounts → kai@phoenixautomation.ai → Warmup

### Next person should start with
1. **Kai:** In Instantly dashboard — delete all leads in the campaign with ashleyedwards305@gmail.com and muneebfiaz201@gmail.com; then re-run [PA] Outreach Agent manually
2. **Kai:** Enable email warmup for kai@phoenixautomation.ai in Instantly (Settings → Email Accounts → Warmup toggle)
3. **Haris:** Delete old Airtable prospect rows 7–14 (partial/bad records from today's broken run) then trigger [PA] Lead Generation manually to confirm AI Research Agent generates real ICP domains + Hunter.io returns named contacts
4. Read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md for full context

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v4.5, Lead Gen + Outreach Agent updated in registry, Known Issues + In Progress updated, session handoff
- **n8n workflows updated via API (no local file changes):**
  - `[PA] Lead Generation` (YO3f5CL9bYbLTBgw) — Hunter.io swap, AI Research Agent, Split Into Items rewrite, source fix, empty-contact filter (17 nodes)
  - `[PA] Outreach Agent` (Mib6RUtJ2IOaUZ4s) — branded HTML email template, Build HTML Emails node, return format fix (12 nodes)

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-06 (Session 17 — Native AI Nodes + Workflow Audit)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
1. **Full workflow audit** — all 15 [PA] workflows checked; 9 were using raw HTTP Request to Anthropic API
2. **Native AI node migration — 9/9 workflows** — all Claude calls now use `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm` (Basic LLM Chain) + `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatAnthropic` (Anthropic model sub-node) with the existing "Anthropic account" credential (`fKRThaHCAxKe1JBQ`)
3. **All response parsing code updated** — downstream Code nodes that read `$json.content[0].text` updated to `$json.text` (correct LLM Chain output format)
4. **Workflow Builder multi-automation support added** — now handles automation_2 for clients with multiple automations; IF node routes to second Claude chain + second deploy node + results merge
5. **Verified clean** — all 9 pass: no raw Anthropic HTTP, correct native node types, correct credential, no stale content references

### Workflows migrated to native AI nodes
| Workflow | Chain node name | Active |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Status Update Agent | Claude — Email | YES |
| Scoping Agent | Claude — Scope | YES |
| Website Chatbot | Claude — Score Lead | YES |
| Outreach Agent | Claude — Email Sequence | YES |
| Scope Approval | Claude — Proposal | no |
| Workflow Builder Agent | Claude — Workflow 1 + Workflow 2 | no |
| Typeform Lead Qual | Claude — Score Lead | YES |
| Referral Trigger Agent | Claude — Referral Emails | no |
| Reporting Agent | Claude — Report | no |

### No-AI workflows — unchanged and correct
- [PA] Onboarding Automation — no AI needed (pure task orchestration)
- [PA] Error Handler — no AI needed
- [PA] Lead Generation — no AI needed (data fetching/dedup)
- [PA] Credential Follow-Up — no AI needed
- [PA] Credential Detector — no AI needed
- [PA] ClickUp Sync — no AI needed

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-03 (Session 16 — Full Cloud Automation Architecture)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### Architectural shift completed
The system is now fully cloud-based. automation-scoping-agent and workflow-builder-agent no longer require Claude Code running locally. Everything runs in n8n Cloud. Kai's only manual steps are: (1) approve scope via email link, (2) review + send proposal, (3) activate built workflows in client's n8n.

### New project_status flow
```
lead → call_complete → scoping → scope_review → proposal_sent
  → payment_confirmed → onboarding → onboarding.in_progress
  → build.ready → building → build_review → live
```

### What was built this session
1. **15 new Airtable fields** on Clients table: call_notes, scope_summary, automation_count, automation_1/2/3_name + description, scope_locked_at, proposal_draft, workflows_deployed, build_review_url
2. **5 new project_status values**: call_complete, scoping, scope_review, building, build_review
3. **[PA] Scoping Agent** (E24KwVMam1e8bbjT) — Kai posts call notes to /scope-call OR sets project_status=call_complete in Airtable → Claude generates full scope → writes to Airtable → emails Kai scope summary + Approve button
4. **[PA] Scope Approval** (UB6ZdrnYpJlYfxD4) — Kai clicks Approve in email → locks scope_locked_at → Claude writes proposal draft → saves to Airtable → emails Kai the draft to review and send
5. **[PA] Workflow Builder Agent** (fy8OuUEGyyWhYzWC) — polls build.ready clients hourly → reads scope from Airtable → Claude generates n8n workflow JSON → deploys to client's n8n via their API key → sets build_review → emails Kai direct links to review workflows

### Kai's new end-to-end flow (post-session 16)
1. After assessment call: POST call notes to https://kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/scope-call (or set project_status=call_complete + fill call_notes in Airtable)
2. Receive scope review email → click Approve → proposal draft emailed automatically
3. Review proposal → send to client yourself
4. Client pays → Onboarding Automation fires automatically
5. Credentials arrive → Credential Detector sets build.ready automatically
6. Workflow Builder deploys workflows to client's n8n automatically → Kai receives review email
7. Review workflows in client's n8n → activate them

### New n8n workflows — IDs
| Workflow | ID | Webhook |
|----------|----|---------|
| [PA] Scoping Agent | `E24KwVMam1e8bbjT` | POST /scope-call |
| [PA] Scope Approval | `UB6ZdrnYpJlYfxD4` | 9 | GET /approve-scope?client_slug=X | 🟢 Active — creates ClickUp proposal review task; stores proposal_draft in Airtable source-of-truth |
| [PA] Workflow Builder Agent | `fy8OuUEGyyWhYzWC` | 21 | Poll hourly + manual | 🔴 Inactive — owner email routing and batch size patched 2026-04-24 |

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v4.3
- **Airtable:** 15 new fields on Clients table, 5 new project_status values
- **n8n:** 3 new workflows created, all connected to Error Handler

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-03 (Session 15 — Gap Closure + Lead Readiness)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
1. **Full project audit vs blueprint** — confirmed 2 blueprint gaps (chatbot, credential handoff) + verified proposal-drafting-agent is fully built (no gap)
2. **[PA] Credential Detector built** — ID: hbtSbm2pzrHX1QTn, 10 nodes; polls every 2h for clients with onboarding.in_progress + n8n_api_key populated → auto-sets project_status=build.ready → emails Kai "start the build"; connected to Error Handler
3. **[PA] Website Chatbot built** — ID: EPMCxdqKOuwc6hzB, 15 nodes; stateless webhook /website-chatbot; accepts step + context; routes step 0–2 (questions), step 3 → Claude scoring (hot/cold/borderline) → writes hot prospects to Airtable + returns Calendly link; connected to Error Handler
4. **Chat embed widget created** — docs/website-chatbot-embed.html; copy/paste snippet, CORS-enabled, animated typing indicator, clickable Calendly link, mobile-friendly; CONFIGURE: change WEBHOOK_URL to prod after activating
5. **Mock client created** — docs/clients/sarahs-wellness-studio/; process-map.md + scope-of-work.md for Typeform program admission use case; fully scoped for workflow-builder-agent test run; estimated $2,400 Starter Build, 7–12 hrs/week saved for client
6. **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md v4.2** — all new workflows added to registry + node summaries; Known Issues updated; activation order updated

### Workflow IDs — new this session
| Workflow | ID | Notes |
|----------|----|-------|
| [PA] Credential Detector | `hbtSbm2pzrHX1QTn` | Activate with other core workflows |
| [PA] Website Chatbot | `EPMCxdqKOuwc6hzB` | Activate + embed widget on website |

### What Kai must do next
1. **Activate workflows** (full updated order now in TODO section above)
2. **Embed chat widget** — open docs/website-chatbot-embed.html, copy the marked section, paste before `</body>` on your website. After activating [PA] Website Chatbot in n8n, the production URL is `https://kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/website-chatbot`
3. **Test mock client pipeline** — run workflow-builder-agent in Claude Code against docs/clients/sarahs-wellness-studio/scope-of-work.md to validate the full delivery pipeline
4. **Connect Stripe webhook** (see previous session)

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v4.2
- `docs/website-chatbot-embed.html` — new: embeddable chat widget
- `docs/clients/sarahs-wellness-studio/process-map.md` — new: mock client process map
- `docs/clients/sarahs-wellness-studio/scope-of-work.md` — new: mock client scope of work
- **n8n changes (via API):**
  - [PA] Credential Detector created (hbtSbm2pzrHX1QTn) — errorWorkflow connected
  - [PA] Website Chatbot created (EPMCxdqKOuwc6hzB) — errorWorkflow connected

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-01 (Session 14 — Launch Readiness)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
1. **ClickUp API key updated** — credential hLrtpicYXOOXrUh0 updated with new key; ClickUp API confirmed live (team 90141018999)
2. **Typeform webhook re-enabled** — pa-n8n-intake set to enabled: true via API
3. **Typeform Calendly URL fixed** — thank-you screen redirect updated from placeholder to real Calendly URL
4. **pa-instantly credential created** — ID: xoSojCyLffw4nNe7 (httpHeaderAuth, Bearer token)
5. **[PA] Outreach Agent built** — ID: Mib6RUtJ2IOaUZ4s, 12 nodes; daily 07:00 + manual; generates 3-email sequence per prospect via Claude → queues in Instantly → updates Airtable
6. **[PA] Error Handler built** — ID: JByknkdAgxRmDKp3, 4 nodes; Error Trigger → Format → Log Airtable → Email Kai
7. **Error handler connected to all 9 PA workflows** — errorWorkflow: JByknkdAgxRmDKp3 confirmed on every workflow
8. **automation_logs fixes** — ClickUp Sync log node converted from Code → HTTP POST (now actually writes to Airtable); Referral Trigger log node updated with event/client/timestamp fields
9. **workflow-builder-agent.md prerequisites** — added build.ready gate + n8n_api_key check at top of agent file; committed
10. **Full pre-launch verification** — all 15 checks run; all pass except Instantly campaign (expected — Kai creates it)

### Instantly.ai note
Email account `kai@phoenixautomation.ai` is connected (warmup_status: 0 = warming up). No campaigns exist yet. Before activating [PA] Outreach Agent, Kai must:
1. Create a campaign in Instantly UI (app.instantly.ai → Campaigns → New)
2. Copy the campaign ID from the campaign URL
3. Open [PA] Outreach Agent in n8n → node "Add Lead to Instantly" → update `campaign_id` value

### Blockers for next session
- Kai must activate 6 workflows (in order: Error Handler → Typeform Lead Qual → Credential Follow-Up → Referral Trigger → ClickUp Sync → Outreach Agent after campaign setup)
- Stripe webhook connection (for automated onboarding trigger on payment)
- First real client needed for real data validation

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **KAI ACTIVATION ORDER (in n8n Cloud):**
   a. [PA] Error Handler (JByknkdAgxRmDKp3) — safe to activate immediately
   b. [PA] Typeform Lead Qualification (kXxN7O77ongTMwKG) — starts scoring inbound leads
   c. [PA] Credential Follow-Up (uTnQAq5VlmsHYih4) — starts daily alerts for stalled onboarding
   d. [PA] Referral Trigger Agent (ka6GesSfWVo2FZtU) — starts 30-day post-launch referral
   e. [PA] ClickUp Sync (uiTwYIUk6nIFwLtX) — syncs task statuses every 2 hours
   f. [PA] Credential Detector (hbtSbm2pzrHX1QTn) — auto-promotes build.ready when client submits credentials
   g. [PA] Website Chatbot (EPMCxdqKOuwc6hzB) — activate, then paste embed snippet from docs/website-chatbot-embed.html into website before </body>
   h. [PA] Outreach Agent (Mib6RUtJ2IOaUZ4s) — campaign_id configured ✅ — activate only after email warmup (≥14 days)
3. ~~**KAI:** Create Instantly campaign → update campaign_id in Outreach Agent node "Add Lead to Instantly"~~ ✅ DONE 2026-04-01 (campaign_id: 6817d31e-e8e6-4a09-87de-e3be8e7cfc4e)
4. **KAI:** Connect Stripe webhook: Dashboard → Webhooks → Add endpoint → URL: https://kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/payment-confirmed → Event: payment_intent.succeeded
5. **KAI (mock client test):** To test the full build pipeline with a mock client — run workflow-builder-agent in Claude Code, pointing at docs/clients/sarahs-wellness-studio/scope-of-work.md. This validates the entire delivery pipeline without a real client.

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v4.1, full update: new workflows, credentials, Known Issues, TODO
- `workflow-builder-agent.md` — prerequisites section added (committed separately)
- **n8n changes (via API):**
  - ClickUp credential hLrtpicYXOOXrUh0: key updated
  - Typeform webhook pa-n8n-intake: enabled
  - Typeform form RSsWJkcf: thank-you screen Calendly URL updated
  - pa-instantly credential created (xoSojCyLffw4nNe7)
  - [PA] Outreach Agent created (Mib6RUtJ2IOaUZ4s)
  - [PA] Error Handler created (JByknkdAgxRmDKp3)
  - All 9 PA workflows: errorWorkflow = JByknkdAgxRmDKp3 set
  - [PA] ClickUp Sync: Log Sync Summary converted to Airtable HTTP POST
  - [PA] Referral Trigger Agent: log node updated with event/client/timestamp

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-04-01 (Session 13 — Full System Audit)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **Full live system audit** — queried n8n, Airtable, Instantly, Typeform APIs to verify every workflow, credential, and data layer
- **automation_logs Airtable** — added 4 missing fields: event (`fldLJJlsN4YaEwM1h`), client (`fldAN5uJmukAgaJM4`), notes (`fldszrHm2ZvTPlaMu`), timestamp (`fldQq93QdesxwZszk`) — newer workflows (Credential Follow-Up, ClickUp Sync) were silently failing to log properly
- **Clients table** — added `n8n_api_key` field (`fldxqbU9PIVvurgPl`) — required for workflow-builder-agent to connect to client n8n instances
- **Test data cleaned** — Alice Test, Bob Sample, Carol Demo prospects set to `test-complete`; "Test Company" client set to `closed.no_deal`
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md v4.0** — Known Issues, TODO, Airtable schema, workflow status all updated from audit findings

### Key audit findings (live API)
| Item | Finding |
|------|---------|
| n8n workflows | 8 built; 3 active (Onboarding, Lead Gen, Status Update); 5 inactive awaiting Kai activation |
| [PA] Outreach Agent | `Mib6RUtJ2IOaUZ4s` | 52 | Daily 07:00 + manual | 🟢 Active — duplicate Email 1 lock + Email 2/3 field fixes deployed 2026-04-24 |
| Error handling workflow | NOT BUILT |
| ClickUp API key | Expired (OAUTH_025) — all ClickUp Sync executions will fail until regenerated |
| Typeform webhook | Disabled — workflow inactive caused Typeform to auto-disable it |
| automation_logs | Was missing 4 fields — fixed this session |
| Instantly.ai | 0 sending accounts, 0 campaigns — unconfigured |
| Apollo.io | Free plan — Lead Gen is mock (3 synthetic contacts only) |

### Blockers for next session
- Kai must activate 4 workflows + regenerate ClickUp key before any of them can run
- Instantly sending account needed before Outreach Agent can be built
- Typeform webhook re-enable must happen after Typeform Lead Qual workflow is activated

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **KAI ACTIONS (in order):**
   a. Regenerate ClickUp API key → update n8n credential hLrtpicYXOOXrUh0
   b. Activate [PA] Typeform Lead Qualification (kXxN7O77ongTMwKG)
   c. Re-enable Typeform webhook: `PUT /forms/RSsWJkcf/webhooks/pa-n8n-intake` with `{"url":"https://kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/typeform-intake","enabled":true}` + Typeform Bearer token
   d. Activate [PA] Credential Follow-Up (uTnQAq5VlmsHYih4)
   e. Activate [PA] Referral Trigger Agent (ka6GesSfWVo2FZtU)
   f. Activate [PA] ClickUp Sync (uiTwYIUk6nIFwLtX) — after ClickUp key is updated
3. **KAI:** Set up Instantly sending account (Settings → Email Accounts → Connect in Instantly UI)
4. **Haris (after Instantly account):** Build [PA] Outreach Agent

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v4.0, audit findings, new Known Issues, Airtable schema updated
- **Airtable changes (via API):**
  - automation_logs: 4 fields added (event, client, notes, timestamp)
  - Clients: 1 field added (n8n_api_key)
  - Prospects: Alice, Bob, Carol set to test-complete
  - Clients: Test Company set to closed.no_deal

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-31 (Session 12)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **[PA] Onboarding Automation Node 49 updated** — subject changed to "Welcome to Phoenix Automation — action required before we can start"; new "Step 1 — Set up your n8n account" section inserted before "Your next steps" (n8n.io signup, API key creation, reply with URL + key); all 3 verification checks ✅
- **[PA] Credential Follow-Up built** — ID: `uTnQAq5VlmsHYih4`, 11 nodes, daily 10:00 + manual; fetches Airtable clients stalled >48h on onboarding.in_progress; IF skip if already flagged <24h; emails Kai with company/contact/hours overdue; PATCH overdue_flagged_at; logs to automation_logs; continueOnFail on all HTTP nodes; inactive
- **[PA] Typeform Lead Qualification built** — ID: `kXxN7O77ongTMwKG`, 13 nodes (prior session); Typeform webhook registered (tag: pa-n8n-intake, secret: pa-typeform-2026); Typeform form created (ID: RSsWJkcf)
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated** to v3.5 — Credential Follow-Up registered, node summary added, TODO items marked complete

### What is in progress (not finished)
- Gap analysis not yet run (was deferred from this session)

### Blockers for next session
- Outreach Agent still blocked on Instantly.ai
- Update Workflow Builder Agent scope: prerequisite — client n8n API key + instance URL in Airtable `n8n_workspace_id` before agent runs

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **KAI:** Activate [PA] Credential Follow-Up (`uTnQAq5VlmsHYih4`) — no dependencies, safe to activate immediately
3. **KAI:** Activate [PA] Typeform Lead Qualification (`kXxN7O77ongTMwKG`) — Typeform webhook is registered and ready
4. **KAI:** Update Calendly URL in Referral Trigger Agent (workflow `ka6GesSfWVo2FZtU`, node "Build Claude Payload")
5. **Haris:** Update Workflow Builder Agent scope — add prerequisite: client n8n API key + instance URL must be in Airtable before build starts
6. **Haris:** Full gap analysis of all project files (read-only — was deferred)

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — v3.5, Credential Follow-Up registered, Node 49 update noted, 2 TODO items marked complete, session handoff
- **n8n workflows updated (via API — no local file changes):**
  - `[PA] Onboarding Automation` (7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM) — Node 49 subject + n8n setup section
  - `[PA] Credential Follow-Up` (uTnQAq5VlmsHYih4) — created new

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-24 (Session 6)
**Worked by:** Kai + Claude (Claude Code)

### What was completed
- n8n Cloud instance set up at kaiashley.app.n8n.cloud (Business Foundry project)
- All 3 PA workflows imported to cloud:
  - [PA] Onboarding Automation → `7RsRJIqBHFpWZoWM`
  - [PA] Status Update Agent → `94DpGwRPWGRPqCVU`
  - [PA] Lead Generation → `YO3f5CL9bYbLTBgw`
- Post-import audit completed — found and fixed:
  1. Status Update Agent: 2 broken connections (Split Client Records → Get All Tasks From Folder; Get All Tasks From Folder → Merge/Error Skip)
  2. Onboarding Automation: hardcoded Airtable PAT in Update Airtable Record replaced with `predefinedCredentialType: airtableTokenApi`
- All credential bindings confirmed auto-linked on import (pa-airtable, pa-clickup, pa-smtp, pa-anthropic all resolved)
- No localhost URLs found in any workflow — all clean
- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated: cloud IDs, n8n URL, MCP path, version bump

### What is in progress (not finished)
- [PA] Status Update Agent not yet test-executed (n8n Cloud API has no direct execute endpoint for non-webhook workflows — test via editor)

### Blockers for next session
- Haris not yet invited to n8n Cloud (Kai action)
- Outreach Agent blocked on Instantly.ai account

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. Open n8n Cloud editor and run manual test of [PA] Status Update Agent (ensure Status Test Client has `project_status=live` and `clickup_folder_id=90147969224` first)
3. Invite Haris to n8n Cloud workspace

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.2, cloud IDs, n8n URL, MCP path, Session 6 handoff

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-22 (Session 5)
**Worked by:** Kai + Haris (via Claude Code)

### What was completed
- [PA] Onboarding Automation end-to-end test: **PASS** (execution 209)
  - ClickUp folder + 4 lists (Onboarding/Build/QA/Live) confirmed created
  - `clickup_folder_id` written to Airtable, both emails sent
- Bugs found and fixed during testing:
  1. ClickUp API v2 doesn't support nested folders — changed to `POST /api/v2/space/90144568071/folder` (space level)
  2. HTTP list creation nodes: wrong `jsonBody` expression format — fixed to plain JSON strings
  3. Airtable `filterByFormula` single-quote bug — fixed to double quotes
  4. `Extract Tools Required` hard error on empty tools — changed to graceful warn + 3-level fallback
- Discovered stable n8n API key: "FlowPilot OS" (no expiry). "phoenix-local" key has `exp` claim and is unreliable.
- Confirmed ClickUp API key: `pk_198267967_P2B3ZQTSNOTEJO5BVZ83PQBU3V0M3R2B` (from decrypted pa-clickup credential)
- Cleaned up test ClickUp folder (90147998711 deleted), Status Test Client Airtable record reset to test-complete
- Workflow deactivated after testing (as per project rules)

### Blockers for next session
- Haris does not have n8n access yet (Kai setting up n8n Cloud)
- Outreach Agent blocked on Instantly.ai
- Meridian test record has stale n8n workspace/credentials IDs — clean before first real client

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai:** Plan client n8n model session — onboarding flow needs updating before first real client
3. **Haris:** Build [PA] Reporting Agent once n8n Cloud access is ready

### Files changed this session
- `docs/clients/phoenix-automation/build-log.md` — updated [PA] Onboarding Automation status, node list, test results, bugs fixed
- `docs/setup/clickup-structure.md` — updated structure to reflect space-level folders (ClickUp API constraint)
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.1, Known Issues updated, TODO updated, Session 5 handoff added

---

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-22 (Session 4)
**Worked by:** Kai + Haris (via Claude Code)

### What was completed
- 10 Airtable Clients fields added (n8n_workflow_ids, hours_saved_per/week/year, last_month_executions/errors, total_executions, referral_source, referral_sequence_sent, lead_score_total, pre_call_brief)
- `clickup_project_id` renamed to `clickup_folder_id` in Airtable + both workflows
- [PA] Onboarding Automation updated: replaces folderless list with folder + 4 lists (Onboarding, Build, QA, Live). Now 24 nodes.
- [PA] Status Update Agent updated: reads all tasks from folder via team API (`folder_id[]` param). Now 15 nodes.

### Blockers for next session
- Haris does not have n8n access yet (Kai setting up n8n Cloud)
- Outreach Agent blocked on Instantly.ai

### Next person should start with

# Change Log

- **[2026-04-27]** — Full live workflow audit via n8n/Airtable/ClickUp APIs: latest runs checked for all 17 `[PA]` workflows; all workflows present; Reporting Agent and Workflow Builder Agent remain inactive by design. Patched Split in Batches loop branch wiring in Outreach Agent, ClickUp Sync, Credential Follow-Up, Credential Detector, Scoping Agent, and Workflow Builder Agent; fixed Outreach reply extraction return shape; updated Workflow Builder Agent to current `build.in_progress` → `build.complete` Airtable flow and removed fragile Airtable field restrictions. Verified final audit has zero structural warnings. Removed Acme Test Co from Airtable Clients while leaving mismatched Brightline ClickUp folder untouched.

## Session Handoff — 2026-03-27 (Session 11)
**Worked by:** Haris + Claude (Claude Code VSCode)

### What was completed
- **FIX 1 — ClickUp space renamed** to "Phoenix Automation" (color #1B2A4A) — space 90144568071
- **FIX 2 — Client folders recreated with full task seeding:**
  - Deleted stale root-level folders (old BPM 90148085794, old MCG 90148117751)
  - Created brightline-property-management (90148144284) + 4 lists + 7 tasks seeded
  - Created meridian-consulting-group (90148144286) + 4 lists + 7 tasks seeded
  - ⚠️ ClickUp v2 API limitation confirmed: `POST /folder/{id}/folder` returns 404 — folders must be created at space root, not nested under Client Projects. Documented in Recurring Bugs.
- **FIX 3 — Airtable: 4 new fields added** (clickup_list_onboarding/build/qa/live) and Brightline + Meridian records updated with all new IDs
- **FIX 4 — Onboarding Automation updated** (24 → 31 nodes):
  - Nodes 19–25: 7 task seeding HTTP POST nodes (auto-seeds tasks into all 4 lists)
  - Node 26 (Merge ClickUp Folder ID): now captures all 4 list IDs alongside folder ID
  - Node 27 (Log ClickUp Error): now sets all 4 list IDs to null on error path
  - Node 28 (Update Airtable Record): now writes clickup_list_onboarding/build/qa/live + onboarding_started_at
- **FIX 5 — Airtable cleanup:**
  - Deleted 3 blank/junk rows (rec7XfoO4a8sjZFTW, recWakBWZEMEu2wG2, reczHE2U5O52aB6Sd)
  - Status Test Client: slug fixed to "status-test-client", clickup_folder_id cleared
- **Welcome email fix** (from Session 10 continuation): removed "reply with credentials" CTA, added security notice, welcome + follow-up framing
- **Full ClickUp audit completed:** space structure, workflow node audit, Airtable field audit, edge case analysis — all documented
- **Calendly clarified:** API key not needed for current scope — webhook-only integration sufficient
- **Instantly.ai API key received** (MWFiM2VjZjMtYWEwYy00YWQ1LWEzYTMtNWNkOWMwYzc5MmViOmFVSkNIYlFSbGNlbQ==) — pa-instantly credential ready to set up
- **Session 11 continuation (same date):**
  - Tested ClickUp list template `t-901414909247` — confirmed template does NOT auto-seed tasks (both test lists created via `template_id` param had `task_count: 0`). Decision: keep 31-node workflow with individual task seeding as-is.
  - Deleted 4 lists: 2 template test lists (901414909658, 901414909660) + 2 stale space-root lists (meridian-consulting-group 901414583912, ashley-edwards 901414584147)
  - Status Update Agent TASK URL verified: `folder_ids[]` (with 's') — correct. Fixed typo in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md description (was `folder_id[]`).

### What is in progress (not finished)
- Referral Trigger Agent E2E Step 6 still pending — Brightline is test-complete so filter returns empty. Kai needs to temporarily set to `live`, run the agent, then revert.
- Reporting Agent: Fetch Executions node credential needs switching to pa-n8n-api

### Blockers for next session
- Brightline referral test: must temporarily set `project_status=live` to test
- Instantly.ai credential: set up pa-instantly in n8n before Outreach/Referral agents can send live emails

### Next person should start with
1. `git pull origin main` then read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. **Kai:** Set up pa-instantly credential in n8n using key MWFiM2VjZjMtYWEwYy00YWQ1LWEzYTMtNWNkOWMwYzc5MmViOmFVSkNIYlFSbGNlbQ==
3. **Kai:** Set Brightline `project_status=live` → run Referral Trigger Agent → verify → revert to test-complete
4. **Kai:** Set up Calendly webhook → paste n8n webhook URL in Calendly → Integrations → Webhooks (no API key needed)
5. **Haris:** Build [PA] Reporting Agent (scope ready in docs/workflows/build-scopes/)
6. **Haris:** Build automated credential collection follow-up email workflow (unblocked)

### Files changed this session
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — version 2.9, template test conclusion, 4 stale lists deleted, Status Update Agent URL typo fixed, Session 11 continuation handoff

  - Added `Extract All Task IDs` Code node — maps all 23 task creation responses to `clickup_task_*` field names
  - Updated `Merge ClickUp Folder ID` to read from `Extract All Task IDs`
  - Updated `Update Airtable Record` to write all 21 clickup_task_* fields + 4 list IDs
  - Added 3 mark-complete HTTP nodes: OB Airtable, OB Internal, OB Welcome (mark complete after each action fires)

- **Part 3 — workflow-builder-agent.md updated:**
