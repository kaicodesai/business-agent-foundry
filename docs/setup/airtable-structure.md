# Airtable Structure — Phoenix Automation
**Version:** 1.0
**Last updated:** 2026-03-20
**Base ID:** `appMLHig3CN7WW0iW`
**Status:** Blueprint — not yet fully implemented (5 fields missing from Clients, additional fields proposed)

> This document is the canonical definition of the Airtable schema for Phoenix Automation.
> Every field is defined with its type, which agent/workflow writes it, which reads it, and whether it is required.
> Update this file whenever schema changes are made and add an entry to the Change Log in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md.

## Tables Overview

| Table | Table ID | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|---------|--------|
| Clients | `tblfvqqyYukRJQYmQ` | One record per client — tracks the full client lifecycle | ✅ Exists |
| Prospects | `tbluEsKoQ2p49ktVq` | One record per outbound lead sourced from Apollo.io | ✅ Exists |
| Automation Logs | `tblL7tDAh1KTLtwpt` | One row per lead-gen workflow run — aggregate stats | ✅ Exists |

**Decision for Kai:** No new tables are needed at this stage. Proposals, invoices, and referrals are tracked via fields on existing tables or via external tools (Stripe for invoices, Instantly.ai for referral sequences). A `Workflow Executions` table is not needed — the reporting-agent reads execution data directly from the n8n API.

## Table 1 — Clients (`tblfvqqyYukRJQYmQ`)

> ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always use table ID `tblfvqqyYukRJQYmQ`. The longer variant causes 403 errors.

### Core Identity Fields

| Field Name | Type | Written By | Read By | Required | Notes |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|----------|-------|
| `company_name` | singleLineText | Onboarding webhook | All agents | ✅ Required | Primary field. Onboarding automation reads `body.company_name || body.client_name` |
| `email` | email | Onboarding webhook | status-update-agent, reporting-agent, referral-trigger-agent | ✅ Required | Client billing email — destination for all automated emails |
| `contact_name` | singleLineText | Onboarding webhook | status-update-agent, reporting-agent | ✅ Required | Billing contact name — used in email salutations |
| `client_slug` | singleLineText | Onboarding automation (Code node) | onboarding-automation, workflow-builder-agent, all file-path agents | ✅ Required | Derived: `company_name` slugified (lowercase, hyphens). e.g. `meridian-consulting-group`. Used to name ClickUp projects and repo file paths |
| `industry` | singleLineText | Lead qualification agent / Manual | proposal-drafting-agent, outreach-agent | Optional | Client industry vertical |
| `client_timezone` | singleLineText | Manual (owner sets post-onboarding) | status-update-agent | Optional | e.g. `America/New_York` — used to time weekly status emails |

### Lead & Qualification Fields

| Field Name | Type | Written By | Read By | Required | Notes |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|----------|-------|
| `lead_score_grade` | singleLineText | lead-qualification-agent | onboarding-automation (Airtable lookup), reporting-agent | Optional | A, B, C, D — from Typeform scoring |

| `lead_score_total` | number | lead-qualification-agent | Owner | Optional | 0–8 numeric score from Typeform scoring dimensions |

> **Note for Kai:** `pre_call_brief` and `lead_score_total` are currently NOT in the Clients table — they are implied by the lead-qualification-agent spec. Decision needed: should these live on the Prospects table (as the lead record before conversion) or be copied to Clients on conversion? Recommendation: add them to **Prospects** (where they are first written), and only copy `lead_score_grade` to Clients (already done).

### Clients Table — Implementation Summary

**5 fields confirmed missing (add now):**
| Field | Type | Priority |
|-------|------|---------|
| `proposal_value` | currency | Medium |
| `project_launch_date` | date | High — referral-trigger-agent cannot function without this |
| `last_report_sent_at` | date | High — reporting-agent writes this |
| `referral_sequence_sent_at` | date | High — referral-trigger-agent writes this |
| `notes` | multilineText | Low |

**Proposed new fields (add before building reporting/referral agents):**
| Field | Type | Needed By |
|-------|------|----------|
| `n8n_workflow_ids` | multilineText | reporting-agent |
| `hours_saved_per_run` | number | reporting-agent |
| `report_count` | number | reporting-agent |

**Decision for Kai:** Add all 5 missing fields now. Add the 10 proposed fields before building the reporting-agent (next after outreach-agent). Recommend adding them all at once in one Airtable session to avoid disruption.

## Table 3 — Automation Logs (`tblL7tDAh1KTLtwpt`)

| Field Name | Type | Written By | Read By | Required | Notes |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|----------|-------|
| `workflow` | singleLineText | lead-generation-agent | Owner (monitoring) | ✅ Required | e.g. `[PA] Lead Generation` |
| `run_at` | dateTime | lead-generation-agent | Owner (monitoring) | ✅ Required | ISO 8601 |

**All 6 existing fields confirmed correct. No changes needed.**

**Decision for Kai:** Consider whether other workflows should also log to this table (e.g. outreach-agent logs emails sent per run, reporting-agent logs reports sent per run). Recommended: yes — extend this table to be a universal run log. Add `emails_queued` and `reports_sent` fields when those agents are built.

## Field Status Summary

| Category | Count | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Existing Clients fields (confirmed correct) | 17 | ✅ No changes |
| Missing Clients fields (add now) | 5 | ⚠️ Add before next agent build |
| Proposed Clients fields (add before reporting/referral agents) | 10 | 📋 Kai to confirm |
| Existing Prospects fields (confirmed correct) | 10 | ✅ No changes |
| Proposed Prospects fields (add before outreach/lead qual agents) | 4 | 📋 Kai to confirm |

## Decisions Needed from Kai

| # | Decision | Recommendation |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Add 5 missing Clients fields now? | **Yes — add now.** All required by agents already defined |
| 2 | Add 10 proposed reporting/referral Clients fields? | **Yes — add before building reporting-agent** |
| 3 | Add 4 proposed Prospects fields? | **Yes — add before building outreach-agent** |
| 4 | Should `lead_score_total` and `pre_call_brief` live on Prospects or Clients? | **Recommendation: Prospects only.** They are lead-stage data. `lead_score_grade` (already on Clients) is sufficient for delivery tracking |
| 5 | Extend Automation Logs table to cover outreach + reporting runs? | **Yes — recommended** but not urgent |
| 6 | New tables needed? | **No** — current 3 tables are sufficient for all 9 agents |
